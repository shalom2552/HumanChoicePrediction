Everything nice here Staff is friendly Hotel is perfect  ,10
Very friendly staff nice location and beautiful hotel.  The rooms have wooden floors that receive a lot of noise from adjacent rooms and corridor. Also the airco (serves as heating) isnt quite. Without ear plugs I would not have been able to get a good night sleep. Rooms are also fairly cold.,7.5
Good place well recommended No bad points at all.,9.6
This hotel is located at a beautiful spot in the center of the town. It is a former Watermill. Breakfast is just good. Beds are good. I slept very well. ,8.3
The breakfast was fine and the staff to. Top location ,8
Lovely location.  Staff wr excellent. It was advertised via Booking.com for ¬£80 but with the exchange conversion it was ¬£88.29. Not much but if youre budgeted !!!!! So now how do I account for the extra ¬£8.29,9
the good mix of breads and foods to go on the bread. no kettle in the bedroom,9.6
Have stayed many times now so like the property because of its location and a different feel. Breakfast should be improved and lighting in the bedroom,7.5
Room was very nice in converted old water mill Town was very quiet and not a lot going on.hotel seemed to be shut down at 8.30om.bit like a b and b.,7.9
Style and breakfast Shower in the bath,7.1
Design and service. Simplicity Prezracenost sobe.,9.6
We stay here regularly and every time it is great.  Clean tidy quiet rooms. Comfy beds and good breakfast - what else could anyone ask for? Bar open longer?,9.6
Location very unique. Quiet environment. free parking. Historical building above the river.Breakfast was very nice lots of choice good illy coffee ‚òï  Staff gave us the smallest room with 2 separate beds..  As a couple this is.. Despite the fact the hotel was 80% empty and possesses great rooms with excellent views.. Missed opportunity to get a  rating..,8
Location of the hotel and the staff treatment Walls between rooms are not enough as you cant sleep if you neighbor is talking due to the voice transfer ,7.5
The place is really extraordinary! Wi-fi signal was poor in my room,8.8
Location is excellent if you are visiting the Werchter rock festival ,7.1
Friendly staff nice environment clean room and very good breakfast. The acoustic isolation between the levels could be better.  In case of noisy neighbours earplugs are recommended.,8
The property is an old water mill with new wings built on. Our room was in the new part but out adjoining bathroom was in the old part a step down. Quirky but with a certain charm. Nice view of the river. Rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. Free parking and a short walk to the town centre. Difficult to find due to the road closures that seem to plague Belgian towns.,8
A historic property with a beautiful setting over a stream ,9.6
The hotel itself is in a lovely location and the rooms and interior have kept the rustic feel and decor of the old watermill which the building used to be. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and comfortable and the big bath was a HUGE bonus for a weary traveller ! Access to the car park is tricky if you are travelling in anything bigger than an SUV and would be impossible in anything bigger than a Transit-style minibus as it involves crossing a narrow bridge which also bends at the end. However the hotel DO make you aware of this so its not a surprise. Im also not a fan of keypad after-hours entry which the hotel has but thats just me...,9
The area. The noise from other guests who came in at 2 am.,7.9
The location The guests were so rude and there was no place to drop the luggage before the check-in which is too late (16:30). Then as I only have one day in chimay and due to the late check-in hour I was not able to visit the abbey which was the purpose of my trip to chimay. ,5
Charming friendly and location Bed toilet and shower,7.5
Amazing romantic hotel in the heart of Chimay! The room was super clean and decorated in a unique and tasteful way. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast served is home-made and the best jam weve had. I wish we had booked a longer stay here! ,10
Located right across from the church in a cosy townhouse with a real Belgian feel. Excellent homecooked breakfast. ,8.8
Very cute b&b friendly owner great breakfast free parking lot just outside. Everything super clean and comfortable beds. Travelling with a friend but there was no real door between room and bathroom. Would be perfect for couples but now not much privacy.,10
Excellent location stylish room very tasty breakfast and friendly owners! ,9
great location very nice looking room nice and friendly owners. small bed,7
Wide and cozy room.Very nice breakfast. ,10
Wonderful B&B lovely individual rooms really comfortable and ith a friendly and helpful owner. Great location and great breakfast too. ,10
well located for the centre of Chimay friendly and helpful hosts Restaurants close by and easy parking. Cats free to roam the breakfast room,7.9
The personal welcome the delicious personally served breakfast with homemade jams and  pain perdu the convenient location along with the beautifully maintained authenticity of the building. A total gem!!  Nothing it was great,10
Central location. Property itself was not upto the standard we had come to expect on the the Continent considering the cost for a night is $125 we had stayed at far superior establishments for less money. However the proprietor was  very pleasant the breakfast could have been more substantial.,6.3
Very cozy and comfortable place in an amazing location in Chimay. The hosts were super friendly and welcoming! We would love to go there once again! ,8.8
Very kind Brigitte! Great breakfast! Too many stairs!,8.8
This is the most amazing property. A home from home as very well equipped. Excellent host. ,10
The property is clean and in a decent area. We were able to park our minivan on the street and only had to pay $6 per day for parking. The property is located about 1.2 miles from most of the restaurants and shopping so its a perfect way to eat and still get your exercise in at the end of the day. The owner of the property is extremely friendly and speaks great English. The only issue is the steps leading upstairs. They are extremely slippery especially if you are wearing socks. The steps on the last floor are even more narrow and more slick. If you have kids they need to be careful walking down. ,8
The townhouse is very spacious comfortable well equipped and clean. We had a friendly welcome by Sabine and communication before and during our stay was smooth. Parking garage close by the house came in handy. Location between station and city centre is good.Lots of stairs which could be an issue. ,9.6
The property was very well maintained and very clean. It also hade everything you would need such as towels linen full kitchen etc etc. Secure parking was very helpful as well. If I was to pick I would say no ground floor wc.,9.6
We loved everything about stay in the townhouse it really was exceptional. Upon arrival we were greeted by Sabine who was so welcoming and friendly. She took time to show us around the house which was perfect very clean and tidy.  Well presented and exactly like the pictures. She was even kind enough to put a welcome pack of food and drinks in the fridge. She showed us how to get to our destination and the best route to take. I cannot recommend staying highly enough it was a perfect visit and we are hoping to visit again next year. It couldnt be improved.,10
Beautiful modernized traditional Belgian home.  Very clean and well kept.  Only a 10-15 minute walk to the centrum shopping and restaurants.  It was a wonderful base to explore Ghent and the surrounding Flanders area (Brugges Brussels and Antwerp are all less than an hour away).  Parking is offsite but only a 3-5 minute walk to a secure garage in a gated enclosure.  Washer and dryer onsite.  The host is very friendly. Alot of stairs.  Enough stairs that if you left something on the top floor you really gave some thought about whether it was worth it go up all those stairs to retrieve it.  If you have mobility issues or knee problems this property might not work well for you.,9.6
The house is spacious luxury and homely at the same time. The top floor is a self-containing apartment with bathroom and toilet. The kids liked Netflix on the TV. Nice main bathroom with bath. Sabine is correct and friendly host gave us two separate front door keys. The parking place is actually a garage box 5 min walk away safe and secure but not very big - if you have a big car check with Sabine first. It is possible to park for a short time in front of the house (20 min free parking). The house has 3 floors and the stairs are pretty steep as often in Belgium. Not a problem for us but keep in mind if you have walking difficulties.,9.6
Everything was amazing. The hotel is well stylished and modern the rooms are big breakfast is delicious. This is a fully bio hotel and the lady took time to explain to us what bio ingredients are there in the food. Breakfast is included. You get welcome drinks free cakes roses. Couldnt have been better. Nothing.,10
The location was excellent right near the train station and 10 minutes from the beach. The breakfast was good and the staff was kind and attentive. The room was very clean and the everyday cleaning service was excellent. We also enjoyed a lot the little attentions we received every day: poem water desert fruit. I found the bed not entirely suitable for children as it was too high. The bathroom also does not have a separate space.,9
Very clean charming welcoming host and amazing breakfast ,10
excellent breakfast super comfortable room excellent service  ,9.6
The place was small and cozy. It was extremely clean and updated with modern furnishings. The bed was very comfortable the room was spacious enough the shower was wonderful and the breakfast was excellent. ,9.6
Excellent customer service the staff are extremely helpful! ,10
The staff is amazing too friendly!!! And the best was the breakfast. It exceed my expectations. The shower without door but the design works. Maybe the space between the bed and the tv wall is too short.,9
i would go back to blankenberge just for this place! take some time for the excellent breakfast! nothing,10
Super friendly staff went out of their way for extra wishes.Pets are very welcome. ,9.6
The staff the service the quality of the room the quality of breakfast the peaceful feeling in the hotel.  I liked everything no problem has been encountered. ,10
The hotel was beautiful only a few minutes walk from the beach and the centre of town.  The breakfast was superb and the freshly squeezed orange juice delicious! the staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking was advertised as secure on booking.com but when we got to the hotel it was on street parking. luckily we were able to remove everything from the car but secure parking was one of the things I looked for when booking the hotel.,10
Stayed at the ABC for one night on the 8th December as we were visiting Brugge.  The location is really good only a few minutes to the station and the train journey is under 15 mins. This is a really lovely hotel with extremely welcoming staff stylish modern rooms seriously comfy beds and a delicious breakfast.  The selection of artisan bread was incredible! We would like to come back in the warmer months and visit the beach!  Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable. Nothing!,10
Quiet location & near to the centre. Owner & staff excellent & very keen to pass on their knowledge of the area Nothing,10
Everything was fantastic. The level of finish and attention to detail was amazing. The best Hotel I have stayed in for a very long time and I stay in a lot! ,10
Very large rooms. Very clean. Helpful staff. Fabulous wifi. A bit of a walk to the main street of Middelkerke but we knew that going in. ,9.2
It was really nice. The hotel is good situated. Very clean and pretty.The receptionist was really nice and funny to talk to.Everything was perfect. We really recommend this hotel.  Nothing. It was exceptional.,10
The room was very spacious for the price and everything felt proper. Would stay there again. Getting to the beach to longer than expected. If that is the main destination another hotel would be the better choice.,10
Fantastic room with balkony. Beautiful ceramic floor and bathroom tiles. Perfect Colour-matching. Great taste. ,9
Dinner and breakfast were arranged perfectlyNice hotel clean rooms honesty bar delicious food  Nothing,8
Interieur staff very friendly.  Eveirhing was Perfect,10
We had to book a suite because the standard rooms were all booked. We did however not regret having want turned out to be a small appartment! New comfortably furnished we really did enjoy the place! Breakfast in Corona times is no longer fun because we are missing the choices coming with a buffet. That is NOT the hotels fault! However the coffee was really tasteless. And the bread was a little stale as well.,8
Very nice location hotel and room! Even with Corona the breakfast was superb! The staff is very friendly and always ready to help. We will come back! ,10
Nice leisure room for the kids + big room ,9
Spacious room with large bed. Good breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon. Lots of bottled water gratis. Free coffee in the lounge/bar was a nice touch. Need a room with barrier free toilet. Scrambled eggs need to be kept warmer. A few snacks would have been nice.,8.8
Spacious places Second building still under construction noisy cart track next door,8
Luxurious room Noise from outside was enough to wake us,9.6
Spacious family room with excellent breakfast ( well arranged in this Covid situation). Location is fine. The  current available walking path to the beach goes through a semi- construction site and a bike path but still OK. The surface of the path can be challenging in slippers. I understand that there is another path currently closed down due to works.,8
The room was great and the attention from the staff The room was not thoroughly cleaned every day and we would have loved to have air conditioning,9
Breakfast was good and this place suits us very well.  Perfect location and house has great style. Pillows - hard as a rock.  Thats it really!,9.6
- super clean - great location - good breakfast Super recommended!  Nothing,10
Excellent host very charming authentic building with all characteristics on display. Very clean. Lovely area. ,10
Hosts were responsive. The room is outstanding. Situated in a really nice bohemian area. Breakfast offerings were maybe a little light but still pretty good.,10
Beautiful room with very stylish en-suite bathroom. The host was very helpful. Good location right next to metro stop. The parking was a fair distance from the property. The lady at breakfast told us off for not wearing masks in the dining room even though we were there to eat. She then shut the door and the windows were shut whilst there were other guests in the dining room.,8
Nice and charming place. Well located with a private parking close to the center. Spacious and very clean it was a pleasure to stay there ,10
Modern rooms in a charming house with lots of character - delicious breakfast ,10
It was simply a great time spent in Brussels. The owners are very willing and forthcoming people who make your stay to feel like home - and feel really the good old Brussels. Thank you very much! ,10
Beautiful historical building with comfortable charming rooms. Welcoming guests with a Belgian beer is a nice touch.  The owner Paul was extremely nice and helpful. The b&b is in a quiet neighborhood but is conveniently located a few tram stops away from the city center. Very good breakfast. Highly recommended. There is nothing I disliked about my stay. The only thing that could be improved I suppose is the quality of the toiletries (shower gel and shampoo).,9.6
The overall art nouveau atmosphere of the house was splendid! Also the breakfast was proper fresh and ready upon our request at a rather early hour:-) In house parking price could have been more guest friendly otherwise everything was fine,8.8
Very friendly staff free drinks/beer around the clock. Not everybody of hotel staff speak English..,8
Hotel Location. The noise outside the window.,6.7
Great accommodations beautiful interior design and a great breakfast service. The host was also very helpful and communicative we couldnt have found a better place to stay while in Brussels. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cool and welcoming place to stay. ,10
The very nice service. The rooms style and equipment. The location is spot on. Cold floors and high ceilings,10
Beer on arrival! Really helpful host and beautiful room.  Great location by the tram Nothing,9
Paul is an excellent host. The great view of the room  on the garden. The  integration of the new realizations in the older ones. The place is well connected by tram 3 and 4 ,9.2
The place was very nice the bed was big and comfortable.    Breackfast war realy nice with bio products.  I would stay there  again. ,10
Location quiet and very stylish property. Pillows need upgrading and breakfast could offer more than just scrambled eggs.,8.3
The staff was very kind.  Nice room and bathroom good breakfast.  Tram stop right at the door. There was no elevator,8.8
We dont live that far away but Julien sent me a text the day before the stay with very detailed instructions. It couldnt have been easier to find the place check in and park the car. If youre not driving there is a team stop virtually at the front door. Nothing all good.,10
A beautiful old typical Belgian town house close to the tram stop. Noise from the next room occasionally,9.6
Cant praise it enough. Very nice hotel comfortable room big size bed location is superb. Most importantly Paul was a great host. We were given clear instructions regarding the parking and he was very helpful throughout our stay.  The breakfast staff member doesnt speak any English so communication can be a bit challenging if your French is limited.,10
Across street from tram in a beautiful local (non-touristy) neighborhood of Brussels. Very hospitable owner family. We like staying in places with local character and this place has it yet the rooms are modern and very clean. Good bathroom and shower comfortable bed and linens. The price is right. In my opinion a small change I wish for is more separation between the bedroom and bathroom and more soundproofing but we recognize this may be difficult for this particular space/architectural plan. It was still ok for us. We would absolutely stay there again.,8.3
Everything. A beautiful house great room and secure parking. Thank you to Paul (the owner). ,10
Location owners very friendly and helpful ,9.2
Roomstyling very beautiful Staff very friendly. We could park the car in a private place. They gave us a card so we could use public transport without fuzzing about a ticket first. Breakfastroom is not in the same beautiful stile as the rooms are but serves perfectly for its purpose.,9.2
This B&B is located in a very beautiful house which on its own is worth a visit. The b&b keepers are very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are spacious and modern but with respect to the old features of the house. The tram is right outside the door which will take you to the city centre in 10-15 min. Nothing really but if Id have to nitpick id say that some places could use some extra dusting (but this was minor).,9.2
Very nice room with free parking inside in the garage Clean good location.Front of the property is a tram station.The breakfast was nice and the croissants was delicious  ,10
Brilliant so convenient couldnt be closer to a main line tram stop! Excellent value! Great hosts. Simple/basic but clean and chic! I travelled alone and felt very safe in the area and getting around!  ,10
From arrival to departure youre in a great place safe and confortable. We enjoyed the calm and the nice accommodation. The owner came introducing himself and was very kind to offer a drink. Not any item about this to say all was wonderful and fine.,9
The style of the property mixes contemporary with traditional is a harmonious way.  The staff were friendly and spoke English fluently.  The car parking was safe and adjacent. The breakfast was delicious and kept us going all day. I wondered if our room (which was decided off from the one next door by sliding pocket doors) was as private as if there had been a wall instead. At times I could hear the next door floorboards creak but that is always a feature of old buildings.,9
Very friendly staff clean room convenient parking good breakfast. It was not a problem for me but it might be a bit noisy when more guests are staying in the hotel due to limited soundproofing.,10
Excellent hosts who made our stay very enjoyable a nice renovated product in a beautiful old building in the Forest area of Brussels Tacky breakfast room,8.8
The best accommodation Ive ever had in Brussels! Renovated room stylish look comfi bed good heating system fresh breakfast Nespresso coffee always available location is excellent friendly helpful and flexible staff.  It was tricky to find it at first because only a small sticker (4*1 cm) on the door indicates that youre at the right place. Other than that everything was just perfect.,10
Very nice and hospitable people and Good area of the city Nothing,8.3
Location is good! 5 stops from Bruxelles Midi very convenient. The breakfast is also great.  Nothing,7.5
Really helpful staff very clean room variety of local beers in the fridge great breakfast.  ,10
Beautiful house nice decorated with high ceilings. We enjoyed very much our stay here.  ,9
The B&B was located conveniently next to a metro stop so we were able to be anywhere in the city within minutes. Paul the owner had already loaded tickets onto a metro card for us so that we could immediately get to our sightseeing. Breakfast was simple but very tasty and we were made to feel very comfortable. ,9.2
the character: elegance and authenticity with style ,10
Very charming decorated and furnished in keeping with the age and style of the building A bit noisy as the trams are just outside,8.8
The room and the building are elegant and beautiful. ,9.6
Well located great staff made for a great home base in Blankenberge. ,9
The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel was clean and modern and the breakfast (delivered to the door) was more than enough! Would certainly recommend as a good-value-for-money stay in Blankenberge! Nothing. ,8
Everything was as it should be. Staff friendly (both during the communication before arriving and on location) facilities are clean breakfast has something for everyone. Although check-in is officially after 14.00 we were able to park and check-in at 10.30 which allowed us more free time to explore the town. They also have a nice small childrens play area in the lounge which is nice for families with small kids. We liked everything.,9.6
The room was clean good shower very friendly staff perfect location and above all breakfast was fantastic. Just one minor thing: an additional bin would be useful.,10
Breakfast- exceptionally good solution during COVID. A little bonus was a glass of sparking wine :-). Service was super kind and helpful. Bed was very comfortable. Spa facilities- very clean and relaxing space. Screeching floor in the room.,8
It was very close to the beech and was basically in the town centre we didnt require to use our car . All in all it was perfect for us .  Nothing,8
Room very clean and cosy Perfect location for me just 5 minutes between the train station and the beach. in a quiet walking street Excellent free wifi Staff very kind and helpful Excellent and copious breakfast served in room due to covid restrictions Extreme high value for the price I liked everything really,10
I love the staff they are really accomodating friendly and warm welcoming. The breakfast is excellent ! The room is clean expect I can hear some noise outside but its totally fine. The location is perfect for shopping and groceries and perfect for summer !Handsdown to their lounge i find it so peaceful and romantic !!  During the night there is a strange sound like its like a drops of water through out the night seems like that. Also the sink in the bathroom doesnt drain well :),10
The breakfast is excellent. Owner and staffs are very friendly It is definitely worth to come back again ,9.2
The place is cozzy and confy. The service is amazing all of them are extra nice. The room was perfect for us. The pillows could be better.,9
The staff was wonderful: very friendly supportive without being overimposing. The room was great spacious well equipped clean. The excellent breakfast was delivered to our room due to COVID which was great perfectly on time fresh coffee copious.. ,9
Friendly staff and amazing breakfast buffet. The best location. Close to shops the beach and easy transportation maybe provide iron & iron board,9.6
Sunday my wife and I checked in in the Alfa inn hotel in Blankenberge. Is already our second stay there. Rooms werent ready because we were early immediately we got an upgrade to another very beautiful room. Wow!! What a room. Amazing. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and kind. The next surprise is the breakfast basket. I am a big eater but we had to struggle to enjoy it all. Thank you you have 3 stars but this place surely deserves 5 stars. We will be back!!!!To the staff of the Alfa inn hotel. Two thumbs up So if you ever wanna stay at Blankenberge. One place to go overnight. The Alfa inn hotel ‚ô•Ô∏è All was fine and great,10
Everything was better than expected enough said Fridge didnt work,10
The B&B is amazing so clean and welcoming and in a great location! The rooms are beautiful and the host is very helpful. ,9
Great location from which everything was easily accessible. We had a lovely and comfortable room and the breakfast was great. Would recommend this place to everyone going to Brussels.  ,9.6
A beautiful BnB in the heart of Brussels.  I travel often and I have finally found a place that feel like a home. Friendly staff and beautiful decor. ,10
Very nice place to stay. Great location. Very clean hotel. The stuff was very friendly and helpful. We highly recommend it to anyone. Thanks for everything. ,10
Location was very good. The bed was comfortable. Internet connection was weak. Shower was not as clean as we hoped.,9.2
very tidy room modern and functional equipment very friendly personnel central location environment is not very appealing after shops close room can be locked from outside but not from the inside,8
 Highly recommended!! Vinciane was so generous to upgrade us to the apartment on top floor. Although there is no lift it is worth the stairs..spotless clean kitchen with all ameneties and toiletries provided. We also found a free bottle of champagne and an aroma diffuser as a gift! So sweet! And Alison is the best! Very helpful always smiling and hard-working! Breakfast was nice although it could have some more variation such as eggs and fruits. Location was super..but not if you dont wont to spend money ) as it is in the centre of a long street filled with shops. perfect for women :D walking distance to all atttactions,9
Fabulous stay! The place is cozy comfortable and clean and the staff is accommodating and nice. I really enjoyed my time there and wish I could have stayed longer! ,10
The location is great if you like shopping eating or have to be in the neighbourhood. The best thing about the place is the huge living room/eating place where you can work and relax. The staff is friendly and efficient. I stayed in a room where walls bed linnen etc where all black. Im not a big fan but that is personal taste.  I was afraid the room would be noisy due to the busy street below but that was ok.,9
It was my fourth stay - and every time was excellent. ,10
Probably everything. The staff person was very friendly and helpful. Very personal approach as well feels very cosy there. The breakfast was great too.  And the location is nice - you are next to everything in the center of Brussels. I guess nothing. Only that the during my previous stay I had a bigger room but thats not important.,9
Beautiful and clean rooms warm welcome.  ,9.6
Perfect location making it easier to navigate the city.  Very clean and the host who welcomed us was very lovely. Would definitely stay here again ! ,9.2
If you have to stay in Brussels this is the place. Slightly quirky in a very comfy sort of way. Very tasteful. Very good extremely friendly service but with complete privacy. Nothing,10
Very central - easy access to the train to the Brussels Airport as we had an early departure. Great welcome - clearly a keen aesthetic sense as the property has some beautiful art furniture and finishes. We will come back for longer next time. Lots of stairs which is a pain with big bags but that is the nature of inner city living. We were travelling for a month so had a fair bit of gear to deal with.,10
Comfortable accommodation with an exceptionally good service good central location especially for business traveller. ,9
Very friendly and helpful staff. Also great position and comfy room. ,8
Great place. Very nice host and comfortable working space. Good beds and facilities good coffee to take to needs decent wifi and nice atmosphere. The only small downside was that the area is a bit noisy. A pub downstairs was not a problem since rooms are on top floor but some rooms are quieter than others.,9.6
A lovely place with lovely people in a great location. If youre driving you need to park in the city2 shopping Centre then use the app to go outside. The sign is small its beside a pub.We had a wonderful stay and wished we stayed longer  ,10
The owners were very friendly they are lovely and dedicated people. There were construction workers working through the night! This was unpleasant!,9.6
A beautiful premise with an amazing and kind hostess.  The place is gorgeous very well located (right in the center of Brussels) and the accommodations are top notch. I cant think of a single thing that could be improved even the specific measures against Covid are well thought and efficient. Would come back again anytime ! Thanks a lot Vinciane :) I cant think of anything.. It was really perfect,10
Very good location and value for money. Breakfast was good continental one ! ,10
Good for overnight stay location was everything ,7.9
Breakfast was fine and the limited staff were very friendly. No Air Con in very hot weather. Did have a fan and slept on top of bed.,7.1
Great location with free parking on the road outside. Room a little on the small side.,7.1
Close proximity to Menin Gate & Market Square parking right outside.  Spacious rooms.  Hotel was very clean and tidy and quiet.  We had a room that overlooked the road but did not hear any traffic noise. Couldnt check in until 4.00pm.  We had riden 250 miles and arrived at 2.45pm to be greeted with check in at 4.00pm.  Fortunately they allowed us to leave our biking gear in the corridor and get changed as it was 34 degrees that particular day.,7.9
The location was excellent.  The breakfast was varied. There were no staff on duty overnight.  There was a crack in the bedroom window and a hole in the bathroom ceiling with wires hanging down.,5.4
Great locationExcellent breakfast choiceFriendly and helpful chap on reception The bed pillow was too largeNo free parking close by or on-site. I used the parking meter on the street with an app.,7
Nice location Some areas of the hotel were a bit tried but other areas were well maintained,7.5
Great Hotel in excellent location..Check in staff very Helpful & friendly..Clean rooms & comfy Bed! Breakfast buffet in lovely room also.. ,10
Central location No facilities in room for coffee or tea etc. At ¬£150 for a room for 3 and in 2019. I dont think having tea or coffee facilities are too much to ask. Wouldnt stay again as I have stayed at much better equipped hotels in Ypres just as central. Old room need updated and has the feel of an old guest house. ,7.1
Excellent..Great Rooms & all amenities..Gracious & friendly Host reception staff & check in very good. Light Breakfast was sufficient & welcomed. ,10
Good location near the square and Menin Gate. Room was comfortable and breakfast room was clean and pleasant and  provided a range of options. ,7.1
Room was clean .small but couldnt fault it..you have to start the heating by yourself room wasnt pre warmed..TV bit useless ..no international news channel.. WiFi worked well enough..breakfast adequate..no tea coffee facilities in room..want evening meal try the ypres burger bar ..really nice burgers..almost everyone happy to talk English..all in all ..great ..paid my respects to those who didnt return after the ww1.. Right near the main square..parking is by machine till 6pm then free till 8am..not hard to find past the ww1 gate memorial..,8.8
Very friendly reception. Nice rooms with a joint terrace outside.Great breakfast Everything was okay.,8
Value for money was excellent room size location was great and the hotel reception was good. Also garage parking for up to 6 motorcycles (at a push) Its a minor point but water for boiled eggs needs to be boiling! Also a bigger toaster would help but all in all not a bad stay and value for money. Being able to arrive and drop things off would help as the check in time is 4 pm.,8.3
Central location Tea and coffee in the room would have been good we wake early and would enjoy a coffee in room rather than wait till breakfast at 8 am,7.5
Breakfast was good.  Breakfast room was attractive. There was no facility for making tea or coffee in the room. Supply of soap was meagre.,7.1
 Room was very cold on arrival beds were uncomfortable,6.3
Location and easy access to room Very cold room in the evening no extra blankets. not possible to turn heating on. water not hot enough at the taps but a good shower.,6.7
Location price and helpful staff Breakfast poorSmell in entrance hall,7.9
Excellent breakfast comfortable room very helpful and friendly staff top location. ,10
Location parking undercover on site for our motorcycles allowed allowed to leave bikes in garage after checkout time.  Breakfast was fine. Steep stairs and room a little cramped,7
It was how you would expect in a Belgian hotel. Nothing,9.2
Situated 1 minute walk from the town centre. Polite friendly and informative staff. Very good breakfast. Good value for money.  Tiled floor in rooms very cold even with radiator on.,8.8
Fathers room was ground floor My room was up two flights of stairs. I struggled to safely get my luggage up and had to leave my case in my dads room as I couldnt manage it. There is one staircase which is marble and open to the side and this made carrying hard. There was no offer of help. We were first to check in but their response was simply tough all rooms were allocated but at breakfast the following morning most were occupied by younger men.,5.8
Central for Ypre. No car parking. However plenty of parking nearby. Payable.,9
Breakfast was good and varied the location was very convenient for sightseeing and the Menin Gate. Check wasnt until 16.00 hrs and there is no access to the Hotel before this time so if you arrive and wish to drop your baggage there for safe keeping this is not possible! There is no lift and the Staircase is not very wide with Marble steps and there is no Handrail on the outside which makes carrying luggage up the staircase quite precarious could be a serious problem for older or less able visitors!,7.9
Good location with friendly and helpfully staff. ,9.2
Comfortable rooms and very clean Narrow staircase,7.9
Location spot on Parking a bit iffy but expected for the location,9.2
The breakfast was excellent and good value for money.  The breakfast table was topped up regularly and everything was fresh. There was plenty of choice and the it was served in a lovely dining room it was like being in alarge house rather than a hotel. Nothing everything was perfect and far surpassed my expectations. I would certainly recommend it to friends and I would stay there again if visiting Ypres. It was ideally located and within easy reach of all the main attraction.,9
Visited previously and like the hotel would stay there again ,9.6
 Parking not directly at hotel because of street building works - also made hotel a bit hard to find - presumably only a temporary problem,8.8
The location cannot be faulted a few paces away from the main square. Free parking available about 10 minutes from the hotel on the road after Menin Gate which is called Leopold III Lan. Breakfast was OK. As I think others have stated its a bit more like a B & B than a hotel. Door is locked by 10.00 and once much earlier so you have to access with a code which is not a problem. Ypres has very good restaurants and bars and the In Flanders Fields museum is excellent. There are about 6 chalet style rooms to the rear of the hotel and we had one of those. Decor and facilities I would best describe as basic. Towels extremely thin. Rooms may be better in the main hotel.,5
It was okay but I was a bit lonley as I was the only one staying at the hotel There was no  coffee and tea in the room,8
Great location good sized room friendly staff lovely breakfast.  Not a modern hotel very dated but adds to its charm. Not having a proper exterior window.  There was a roof light that operated from a control unit so still had fresh air and view of the sky.,8
Breakfast was fend for yourself which was ok it was quiet as only appeared to be 2 people staying the breakfast area decor looked old day style that l really liked but might not be to everyones taste. The owners kindly let me park my motorbike in their garage area. My room on the ground floor only had a velux style roof window that closed when it rained (obviously) no other windows for natural air in the room just felt a little airless and stuffy even though there was a fan. Cannot comment on the other rooms.,7.9
The location was great The limited time slot in the afternoon in which you could check-in,8.3
Superb location very secure parking for my motorcycle very clean very friendly host  I cannot fault this hotel  ,10
Older style hotel. No elevator but beautiful sold marble stairwell. Small but comfortable room. Great location right in the middle of the downtown. Nothing,10
Central location  Good breakfast Pricey for one person,7.9
Very well locatedBedrooms better than photos Dated and needs a bit more for the price,6.7
The location was just right. Couldnt get a coffee  only at breakfast time. Room could have been a little cleaner  especially tv and remotes. ,4
Owners friendly and happy to help with most things. Perfectly situated We had an issue with the power blowing in the evening. I call the owner who doesnt live on site and they arrive in approx 15 mins & switched back on but unfortunately the heating did not reset and room was cold. When I mentioned to the owner he said I should of turned the bathroom heater on but this was on a timer and could not be felt in the bedroom.,7
location is great very  clean rooms friendly staff have been 4 times to this hotel would go again there was nothing to dislike,8
Location Draconian rules. Check in not allowed until 16:00 not a minute earlier. No food or drink in rooms despite bar closing at 22:00. Massive sign no picnicking refreshments available at the bar outside the rooms in annexe at rear. ,5.8
Location The check in time is to late we got there at 2 but couldnt check in till 4 ,7.9
Very handy for the attractions of Ypres.....for  a group of men staying in individual rooms it was just what was required. Paid parking a bit of a problem with hotel street and main square blocked off for the weekend by a festival of running...but just bad timing...,7.9
Good breakfast central location.  Comfortable bed. Shower was tepid but resolved on second day.  Radiator was a bit noisy.  Limited storage space. While not expecting a lift the stair to the second floor is rather steep.,6
The bedding is great. It was one of my best sleeps ever. Appreciated  the idea with vouchers for days without cleaning. Gladly converted mine into coffees. My room was too dark for my taste. If the table could be positioned at least partially closer to the window it would be brilliant.,8
 Parking outside of the hotel is not easy.,9.2
I liked everything at this hotel: the room and the breakfast also the staff was super friendly! They listened to what we needed and helped us to organise a small private reception. Big compliments to this hotel and my recommendations!   ,10
Not my first time it. Like it. But why are they so slow with check-in. So annoying.,8
Room was excellent. The area was fantastic - great if you want to know more about the European Parliament and a bit quieter and less touristy than the centre. A great Paul around the corner. The gym was also really good. The room was excellently designed. Reading material was included that was actually really good. The soap dispenser in the bathroom was a bit malfunctioning.,9.6
Great location modern hotel nice breakfast More Dutch/Flemish tv stations would be nice!,8.3
The room is spacious with modern and efficent design very well organized and comfortable big desk if you need to do some work very clean too. Location is great: in the heart of the European quarter. Complementary tea coffee and bottled water. ,9.6
staff always ready to help everything is smooth and clear. you dont have to make big efforts the whole thing just works pretty well. cant mention anything,10
We had an excellent stay. Big nice room comfy bed and great shower. Good location close to many restaurants.   An extra chair for eating would have been appreciated.,10
Comfy bed good location friendly staff ,8.3
Large and beautiful bedroom confortable bed very good welcome service  Towels too smallMoquette on the floorParking definitely too expensive compared to others in the same quartier with same conditions and service ,9
The hotel was fantastic. Staff were excellent and very knowledgeable of the area which helped us get around Brussels with ease. The room was excellent clean spacious and very comfortable. The shower was nice to use after a long day and the bed was comfortable for a good night sleep. Very modern throughout and even had a pool table and table football in the lobby. Finally this place was excellent for us as we were allowed our dog to come with us.  Parking is very limited and charges for a 24 hour period. Rather than per hour.,10
Excellent hotel for the solo business travellers. Very good locality comfortable bed very good sound insulation. ,9.6
 the breakfast could be improved its was a bit poor for a 4 star hotel in europe,9.2
Fantastic and very helpful staff excellent location and comfortable rooms ,9
Nice spacious room. Very clean and great location ,10
Very modern hotel beds are very comfortable room is spacious When checking out the staff could have been more friendlier,9.6
Lots to like about this place the room we were in was huge and the added extras were really appreciated especially the speakers so we could listen to our own music. I loved staying here If they can add a small spa It would get 10/10.,9.6
The lady at reception recognised me as I was returning after 3 weeks. She also remembered that I had not been happy with the check-in process. She made check-in much faster this time and upgraded me to a room with a fantastic view. Very well done congratulations this is fabulous customer service. Nothing.,9
The hotel had a very modern feel and the room was very spacious. The room was on the chilly side and I could not find any additional blankets. In all honesty I must admit not having asked for additional blankets either.,7.5
Was upgraded to a bigger room as mine wasnt ready. Very nice surprise. The room was really big and very clean. Staff are very nice and helpful. Great location. Id stay there again without question Nothing,7.5
The hotel is very well located about 250m from the EU Commission staff are very nice the place is clean and at EUR 100 per night with breakfast included it was excellent value for money. Recommended.  The light from the bathroom/toilet filters into the sleeping area because of the glass wall. This wakes up the other person in the room if the toilet is to be used in the night.,9
New good and conveniently located hotel with decent breakfast offer. Recommended. ,9.2
Luxurious and comfortableNice view from the upper levelsVery obliging staffDelicious dinnerPerfect location Unilateral breakfast,9
Comfy clean and spacy rooms. Fitnessroom. Its small with a limited choice of tools but still a nice addition to the hotel. Carpets in rooms. I generally dislike carpets cause they are dirt catchers. Fruit salad of the breakfast buffet was sour/not good for eating anymore,7.5
Fantastic location and comfort room Nothing I could remember of,9.6
The optional room service. Charity or breakfast! More tea and coffee etc in room if we both wanted indian tea only 1 teabag ,10
The beds are so comfortable! And the room was pretty  ,9
Spacious rooms and friendly staff breakfast selection was not very big,7.5
Excellent staff. Discreet service. I travelled with a dog and the hotel ensured even a gift for the dog. ,10
Very spacious rooms and very fancy great bed perfect shower. They organized a party in the lobby at night drunk people everywhere noise from the dj. In the morning empty glasses everywhere and puke on the streets. Not to cleaver for a hotel like this. Dont know if they do this every weekend if they do their screwed.,8.8
 choices of breafast especially for hot dishes.,8.8
The spacious room and bathroom Lobby was very loud from the restaurant,10
Location is absolutely great right in the heart of the European Quarter the staff was extra nice the room comfortable enough and the Wi-Fi puts other hotels to shame. The only thing I would change would be the lack of a clear curtain during the day. Get too close to the window and they see you across the street.,9
Staff and amenities Nothing to dislike,10
The hotel was in a good location with lots of accessibly transport to central Brussels. There were lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was so comfy and the room was more than adequate and spacious. Having a hairdryer and iron in the room was handy. The staff were friendly and helpful and the bar area was a nice place to relax. The kettle in the room smelt vinegary where it had been descaled and even though I boiled it a few times I couldnt get rid of the smell/taste. To be honest I forgot to report it to reception and it didnt in any way affect my enjoyment.,9.6
Spacious the bed was comfortable Nothing,10
Excellent modern hotel with great location great rooms great stuff great food ,10
The size of the room. The available amenities. The location by the rail. Everything was great. Breakfast was ok.,10
Helpful staff as always! The hotel and the room are not as clean we it used to be. The corridor and the room could be brighter. A bigger bin in toilet might help keep the room Feel cleaner.,8.3
Staff very polite and easy going great rooms breakfast offers wide variety of wide all in all place for a great stay in Brussels!  ,10
ROOm v quiet aircon silent blackout curtains comfortable clean fab shower free upgrade! Cant think of a downside except mayb didnt seem to have hot brekkie,9.6
Clean and comfortable room. Good area close to European Commission and the park. Noise from bathroom at night because of ventilator probably even its door closed Additionally limited options for TV channels.,8.3
Room is spacious bed is comfortable almost all the room was clean (except night table). Breakfast is very modest no hot dishes etc. This category hotel should serve better breafast. And when I wanted to check out morning stuff tried to tell me that they gave 25 Euro deposit (which I paid by card) to some stranger woman in cash and tried to tell me that it is normal because she had some receipt on my name. It was very unpleasant..,8.3
Just a bit of a walk too the town Not much food options,9.2
Great place to stay convenient location very good breakfast there is also a nice breakfast to go option room was spacious and comfortable. Will stay again! ,10
Very nice hotel located near the EU buildings very convenient if one has meetings there. The room was cozy and spacious enough the bed comfortable. It was quiet. WiFi worked well. Staff was polite. ,10
  Nice design of the hotel great beds friendly staff,9.2
Very good value for the price very very clean staff was very nice to me. ,9.2
 Room number 714: dirty carpet  door of shower doesn¬¥t close properly hose of shower has to be replaced,8.3
Modern simple style comfortable bed really easy check-in and -out ,10
Clean room throughout room upgraded for free (thank you!) Easter egg treasure hunt in the room was a nice touch easy access park across the road is perfect for a nice stroll. ,10
As always an easy going base to discover Bruxelles This time a bit sloppy with providing enough coffee thea etc. in the room,9.6
Nice clean well rounded business hotel. Friendly staff always willing to help and assist. Comfortable beds and nice shower. The room is quite big compared with many other hotels in Brussels.  Stylish and in a good location for the European Quarter. We had a room with two beds as a room with one big bed was more expensive even though we did book for two persons. The gym is nice and well equipped but I was missing some machine to do leg work but good bike and treadmill machines.,9.6
Very friendly staff. Very nice & comfy room. Quiet even next to elevator. Choice of good mocktails. The staff in the morning said I could not get points for my stay on my rewards card because it was booked through Booking.com,9.2
The staff was very helpful and kind. The location and the design of the hotel is amazing and in general it was a perfect stau The breakfast had a fairly limited number of choices avaliable,10
The members of staff are always very helpful and friendly - this is the only thing about this hotel that hasnt changed over the years! They are very good at problem solving! Excellent location - extremely safe and comfortable area. well connected with metro and major sight seeing spots. It remains very close to central station. Highly recommended it to anyone who prefers not living right in the middle of the very busy center of Brussels. Level of cleanliness has gone down compared to three years ago. There were grimes on my door of the loo and lift. Carpet started to run down. There were some dirt on the bench. Corridor and the foyer of each floor was way too dark.,8.8
The beds were extremely comfortable! The staff were so helpful and their English was perfect! The rooms were spotless and clean towels were given daily. Our sheets were only switched out once in our 3 night stay,8.8
 The acoustic insulation of the room is very poor,8.3
Very close to all.We could walk to most places. Plenty of resturants with good selection of food. ,10
Loved the room design DIdnt seem to realise it was 2 of us and only left out a bathrobe for 1 person.,8
Super nice and stylish rooms great and comfortable lobby to hang out nice staff. Very good reachable by public transport (Schuman is close by) great restaurants and parks just around the corner. ,10
Nice accomodation good location helpful staff. breakfast could be improved.. same food every day can become boring..,8.3
Sounds system and TV were cool. Bed was nice and comfortable too. Nespresso machine was a nice touch. Toilet paper could have been better! :D,9.2
Easy check-in great team. Comfortable room. Great environment with some music and places to work or have drinks. They have an option of fast breakfasts for 6e50 for 3 items it was a nice surprise. Also an option of Green choice for short stays where you can refuse cleaning (eco-friendly) and get a 5e voucher to spend in the Hotel.  Just across the street from the European Parliament and the House of European History great places to visit. We notice some stains in the linen and in the bathroom. But nothing that would ruin our stay just a small detail.,9.6
Hotel rooms Infact the behaviour of the staff was awesome . ,10
I love this place 5 or 6th stay here Price of breakfast has increased steeply over the past few years. I remember when they were selling it for 8 Euros.,9.6
room design and layout covid-19 restrictions,10
Great location near a tube station great staff and immaculate hotel.  ,10
Staff was very courteous. The plumbing of the washbasin was clogged.,8
The rooms and the hotel were very clean. The rooms were great. The staff was very helpful. The location was excellent. ,10
Room was a great size comfy bed excellent wifi that worked the full 3 days after logging in once. Friendly staff. Liked the lobby/lounge/bar area which has different seating options and was a great place to do some work or have a beer. Room only had one type of curtain (to keep any light out). Great during the night but as there are other buildings really close you had to also close them during the day to avoid neighbors looking into the room. A second thinner curtain would have helped. The hotel signature smell (perfume) was really strong in the lobby and after room service.,8
Great hotel staff helpful and friendly ideal location ,10
The bed was very comfortable the room cozy maybe it would be nice to have some day curtains in the room to cover a little the neighborhood view. Also its nice to have tea in the room.  Breakfast was a little dissapointing. Also there is the feeling that it lacks of air in the corridors and the room.,8
Clean and spacious gym friendly staff size of room. ,10
The services were very good. People were great! The hotel is situated in the European neighborhood so not very close to the center of the city. Overall experience was good! It was very clean and comfortable. ,7.9
Excellent facilities very clean and modern rooms were lovely and very reasonable rates  ,9.6
Very clean and comfy.  The room was bigger than I expected and (unlike many other hotels) the king size bed was actually king size.  All in all a very pleasant experience. ,8.8
The atmosphere and ambiance was fantastic I had a noisy neighbor who had to be told to turn down their music,9
Hotel is in a great location just round the corner from the EU commission and a few minutes walk from the transport museum which has a Renault expo on at the moment. Staff are really friendly and speak both French and English so very easy to communicate. There is a nice bar in the hotel to get drinks such as cocktails if you want. ,9.6
Great location great value-for-money little hotel 2 of the entrance doors were locked for security purposes. I think thats really cheeky even for a 3-star hotel.. parking is a little expensive too seeing its so tight :),7.9
Very comfortable room and bed. Location is perfect. Friendly staff. Overpriced breakfast better move next door to Exki. ,8.8
super happy with my stay here. staff were very helpful. ,10
Wonderful room with excellent facilities good design great shower ,10
 Breakfast of 3 items is difficult to understand. The price of the food itself probably plays minor role in the total cost. So why to have this complicated system?,10
Good modern hotel. Friendly staff. Great location. Close to bus and metro lines ,9.6
- The hotel reception is convivial but as it is round clients tend to stick around (downside: no discretion if you discuss your stay with the representative.) - The lobby is nice and lively maybe not very discreet when it comes to people standing 1 foot away when you pay the staff is friendly and pay attention to details young professionals attitude - the shower is pretty small so its not ideal when you want to relax it also feels pretty cluttered a bigger space with a tub would feel more confortable - the lobby chairs/seats could be a little more comfortable but need to be renovated/renewed the door at the main entrance is permanently locked the sign to go around and enter through the side door makes the entrance a little less fancy than it could be.,7.5
Have stayed there many times. I love it. But the hotel felt very empty did not come across anyone in the lobby. Nothing,8
The hotel is perfect if you had more affordable breakfast would be ideal. I really liked the room very comfortable and with fridge and coffee making equipment. The bed is very comfortable. I found the room excellent. I found the breakfast offer very expensive and there is nothing close to the neighborhood for coffee. Only from 10am in the morning.,9.6
Excellent staff. Perfect location. Great breakfast. Quiet and super clean room. Many thanks ,9
Perfect location walking distance to Berlaymont and to place Jourdan. Large room extra comfortable bed. There was a salsa party at the bar when I arrived. It was too tempting and I danced but reflecting now on the situation I regret I did. I forgot something in the room which was not found after I left when I called. Really strange considering that was a  plastic bottle of white vinegar of a price of 060 EUR.,9
Location was great and the fact we could check in sooner made our trip a lot more pleasant. Place was tidy. The mattress was a bit too hard to my liking and the pillows a bit flat but that is of course a personal preference.  This might as well differ between the rooms.,6
Gentleman on reception was courteous and helpful. Close to beach and right in the town. The lady on reception was rude struggled for any English channels on TV.,7
Positive: good location friendly staff at the reception clean. Negative: tiny room with no daylight (almost all rooms have windows to a small and dark courtyard which is filled with the fire escape stairs) two out of three nights the toilet was broken (I told them after the first night and someone came to fix it but it broke again) very noisy (you hear everything from the hallway and neighbouring rooms) run-down furniture and old uncomfortable mattresses.,5.4
Location. Room eventually Nobody on reception. First room given hasnt been cleaned or bedding changed,6
The staff and the location. Perfect. It was so hot to sleep.,8
Great localization it was really close to the sea shops restaurants. Check-in and check-out process was fast and without any problem the staff is professional. From my window I can go to something like fire escape stairs which was really awesome this is the biggest advantage of this place. In my room I dont have wifi connection. It was the biggest disadvantage the second one room was placed at the end of the very very long corridor when I reached the end I was a little bit tired :P Elevator is a little bit frightening,7
It is well located properly equipped and clean! I think it is good enough for the price paid!  ,7.5
very good location close to beach walk center shopping street and restaurants. Breakfast could be better..only cold buffet with limited choice.,7.1
Good location Cheapest room  The Beds are not comfortable,6.7
Good location friendly staff. The hotel is bit old and the rooms are not very well sound proof. So you (almost) hear everything - the bags rolling shower in the adjacent room people talking. But we were there only for one night so was not a big deal for us. If you are looking for a quite place to stay probably not the best option.,7.1
We were allowed to leave our luggages at the reception of the hotel even before the check in time. The location of the hotel is great very close to the centre and to the beach. When I made the reservation it was written that a parking was available at the hotel. Once we arrived and asked for the parking we were told that we should have reserved the parking before (but this was not specified neither written anywhere when I made the reservation) so we had to look for an other pay parking in the city.,8
Location friendly staff price Bathroom could be cleaner real matrass on the bed,7.5
Location is good. Breakfast is fine. Good value for the money. We paid something around 150 for 2 rooms. Hotel is obviously very old and needs maintenance,7.9
Hotel is in an ideal position to explore Ostend close to the Beach and main shopping area. Good sized room large screen TV with access to UK football Games. Large comfy bed. Bed was big and comfortable but very low. Good shower but toiletries not replaced daily. Parking was full by the time we got there.,7.9
EVERYTHING 1/ Location! City center and 1min away from the beach. 2/ amnesties (in room sauna etc ) also room (view) and organisation in the room were lovely ! I feel very relaxed.3/ breakfast4/ service in general + respect of COVID rules.  I couldve used a bath tub. It was not the end of the world but Im used to it when traveling as well.,10
Extended breakfast buffet with cereals wide variety of bread and toppings clean room with complementary bottle of water very good location near the sea side. For the breakfast there were eggs and bacon but saucages would have been nice. There was a fruit salad but in really top-rated hotels one would also find slices of water melon the frequent tramway passing at the street is an advantage for the location but a disadvantage for the noise.,8
Clean room. Location good a short walk to the sea. Lovely breakfast Could not use hotel restaurant because of a function - however  other good restaurants available a short walk away. Car parking extra.,7.9
Friendly service and a nice breakfast Highly recommended  ,9.2
Excellent breakfast clean rooms super nice staff ,9
Breakfast was fantastic as was the dinner menus that were offered during the weekend. There was a parking possibility available and I also could put my bikes in the garage of the hotel (possibility to charge your e-bike if needed)! The only little thing is the tramline it is just beside the hotel. The noise is not bad and it stops quite early in the evening and doesnt start really early in the morning. But you can hear it pass by but bot much. So all in all it didnt bother me but I did notice it. But on the other hand it is easy to get around when you your tram pass by the hotel :),9
Lovely family-run hotel with beautiful rooms and excellent facilities. Great location near the beach but right by the nice Dumont neighbourhood. Great breakfast and option of snacks/dinner for a bit extra. ,10
Hotel had a good car park close to se front and centre of town. We felt the floor covering was worn and in need of updating also the sliding door to the bathroom could have been a better fit as when the light was on in there it light up the bedroom as well.,8.3
The breakfast was fine plenty of choise There was nothing that I was dissatisfied with,8.8
Very nice hotel/charming staff Nice staff good bar very good food,10
Friendly welcome secure parking and a fabulous breakfast. Room was spotless. Good location: easy to find and just a short walk to promenade and beach. Nothing to grumble about.,9.2
Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was superb. Lift was tiny and shuddered a bit worrying.,8.3
Modern contemporary facilities Slippery shower tray,10
This was our second visit to the Ambassador - its ideally placed for travel to/from UK via the channel tunnel. First-class breakfast great location close to seafront secure parking and a warm welcome. Restaurant was closed on the evening of our stay but the owner directrd us to an Italian restaurant on the promenade. Well be back next time we visit Belgium! Nothing.,9.6
The keys were in a lock box to which we had the code so very easy access. There are 7 short flights of stairs no lift so not ideal for those with very young children or the elderly or infirm. It was not a problem for our party.,9.2
Very Centric location very clean and big open space kitchen fully prepared ..  No stairs,9.2
It was clean. and totaly same as the pictures on the web pages. The location was.. not that close from the main station. ,7.9
The location was very good. It was very clean and the bedrooms were spacious No aircon and it was 35 degrees during the day and hot at night. Also it was on the third floor and no lift. There were fans in the bedrooms which helped a little,9.2
Very spacious penthouse apartment with three well-sized bedrooms. Comfortable beds very clean and in an excellent location!  Dont book this penthouse if youre unable to climb a few stairs. We were all bitten by lots of mosquitoes during the night cant really blame the owner but maybe fly screens in front of the windows could help. ,9.2
Location facilities and comfort It was all good,9
The place is huge and really nice. A lot of light and 3 big bedrooms. The apartment is placed at the end of a street full of bars and restaurants and is walking distance (10min) to the main markets.The place is comfy and really really clean! ,9.5
Location super was easy  to find. good parking. Public transport outside the hotel Its a bit loud public means and other vehicles drive by if your room is street side,7.5
clean room and clean bathroom too hot in the room some noisy outside in the city,7.1
Breakfast was nice and the hotel was clean. You can make free coffee tea the whole day in the lobby bar. The tram/bus station is in front of the hotel which is very convenient. The hotel is not close to the center and the road to the hotel is auwful. I think it is in an industrial area of the city so it is definately a very bad choice if you want to walk to the city center.  The hotel outside is very old and ugly so it`s a very poor quaility for the money spent. I will never book it again and don`t recomment it.,2.9
The staff were truly personable and very helpful.  The breakfast was the best! The distance from the center city was greater than we expected.,9.2
Excellent breakfast helpful staff cleanliness and comfortable bed i was asked to pay an extra 15 euros to delay my check out by 2 hrs,9.6
Good very clean hotel and excellent value for money. Prime location if you have business at the port or the businesses there - dont book it if you want the centre of town. There is free parking in front of the hotel too. I had a room at the back and it was quiet. It is not a flash hotel but it doesnt need to be. Tram & bus stop outside the hotel. Getting to the hotel from the main road (its in a cul-de-sac visible from the main road but you have to drive around the houses to get to it).,9.6
 The overal cleaniness was only average. the bathroom was in general clean but the sink was stained despite seemingly refurbished recently. The carpet also had dark stains behind the bed towards the window. The carpet tiles are easy to remove so I wonder why this is not done?,8
The breakfast was delicious Few sockets in a room,6.7
The lounge Cold rooms just because they werent prepared. Outside temperature 5-8 degrees and still no heating available. The room wasnt clean enough and the breakfast was very simple .,4.6
Very good A bit far from the old city.  You need to take a bus or bycicle,10
We had value for our money. Hotel could be reached perfectly by public transport. No complaints.,10
Good bed friendly staff ideal location when visiting the Kinepolis venue. Bathroom could have been cleaner. Room itself was very hot even though heater was off. Hotel looks somewhat outdated.,6.7
It is the 2nd time that I have stayed in this Hotel For me the staff is excellent the breakfast is nice and continental the rooms are clean and you have the facilities needed the location was good it is not in the center but it is the location that I need as I go often to an event in that area. I really like this place and I made it my official staying destination for when I visit Antwerpen. ALL GOOD!,9.6
Ease of bus connection to the city No air conditioning which meant room unbearably hot in exceptional night temperatures of late thirties,6.7
Breakfast was excellent with a wide range to choose from The Hotel was a little way from the City but the tram service was relatively close,8.8
close to SportPaleis & kinepolis bathroom floor not clean beds not very comfortable unfriendly staff - barely say hello and look at you surroundings a bit creepy,2.9
Clean and cozy free parking good wifi  good breakfast. Welcoming and responsive staff No hair dryer. Not a great problem),9.2
Good location good breakfast very nice lobby with free coffee/tea/water Hotel is too warm also in the room difficult to get temperature down. Second morning there was no hot water (first time this happened in 5 stays).,7.9
Bed and shower ok similar price to ibis budget but beds here are better and balcony a nice touch. Check in guy was friendly No kettle in room room was cold but this was my fault as I left the balcony door open.,8
Easy access to transport into the city from right outside of the hotel. The breakfast was really nice and included in the price. Parking was free and plenty of spaces were available ,9.6
it was quite ok The drilling machine should not run in other room so early..,7.9
Everything is new cleaned comfortable beds.Parking for free.Excellent real coffee beans at the breakfast.Fast check-inn.Kindly personal.Was a bit cold into my double room because the window was opened when I arrived and the heating doesnt work (it is central heating for the building).But at last i slept well. So it was not a problem to me. In the single room of my college was warm. ,10
The lounge was very spacious and offered a billiards table and various board games to play as well as free tea and coffee. The room was very quiet and the bed quite comfortable. Breakfast was very basic. The shower a bit small (for someone of my size: 1.90m and over 100kgm),8.3
Breakfast was very good free parking single room was big enough. not perfectly clean room and corridors hotel can use a bar since its far to any type of hospitality.,9.2
Free water Helpful staff No air conditioning it was hot 30+  The window in the room opened about 5 cm @ the top No air flow,5
Rooms are clean and the breakfast is nice as well. ,10
Good standard hotel nice clean rooms and correct and friendly personal. ,8.3
Is a hotel located on the highway with a free parking area. A clean silent room.   Bathroom was clean and modern inclusive hair dryer. In the morning the breakfast room was full crowded with asian visiters.  It was almost not possible to find a sitting place.,8
free parking free refreshments in lounge and good wifi connection Helpful staff and proximity to public transport Breakfast ok very busy and hectic,9.5
 Stayed 2 nights but on both days there was a huge line for breakfast (around 7.15). Had to skip breakfast to be in time for work. Too bad because the breakfast is fine.,7.1
Unfortunately I did not eat breakfast. However they do offer tea/drinks near the reception. The elevator wasnt working when I stayed. Also it must be due to the weather but I had a hard time sleeping because it was kind of warm. Solved the problem by leaving the balcony door open. Also TV was not working during stay.,7
Standard and over aged Hotel so all is basic but good for short stay only. 24hrs Free coffee is a good initiative. Views from my room (backroom) were a factory roof.   Free Parking in front of hotel is a plus point Rooms are very small and location is far out. No shops around the hotel. Not recommended for families.  No bar in the hotel.  Got the impression it is more a hotel for workers or sailors in standby.,5.8
Price Stayed before at the rear of the hotel . Really quiet.Unfortunately this time had a room overlooking the main road . On a hot night with the window open it was noisey. Good price thought.Breakfast was good .,7.9
Goog lounge and very good breakfast No hair dryer in the bathroom,8.8
Good hotel Bit out of the center but many busses and tram stop in front of the hotel and a train station is 4 minutes away,8.8
Location close to the kinepolis a movie theatre  restaurants are available there. not so close to the city center requires bus and taxi or car to drive to the center.,8
The location was great for us.We were staying for a film premiere in Kinopolis across the road.  Nothing it was fine.,9.2
Breakfast was very good No air-conditioning (with an outside temperature of 40C !),6.7
Breakfast was a good standard - basics done well.  It is the closest hotel to the port so I could walk to work. I couldnt find the wifi access code in the room and had to go back downstairs for it.,9.2
Location was good close to center free parking and wifi. According to the site my room would have ac but it didnt. The room was clean but the hallway and stairs werent that clean.,6
The bed was comfortable and the free coffee is a bonus. A Bar would be a nice addition,9.2
While they do not provide coffee etc in the room it is free downstairs in the bar area It is sort of over a petrol station which at first I wondered about but it was not an issue.,7.5
Food  people No p≈ïiivacy in sinƒ∑area  to many stairs for our age,7.9
Good location nice decorated apartment. Good breakfast but needed to ask since wasnt included in the price and the suggestion of the owner was to have it a la carte what will make it quite more expensive.  Poor sound isolation. Reserved a duplex but got a loft (open spaces). My daughter need to sleep in the living room but light went through since windows dont have curtains!! Stayed 5 days and the apartment wasnt clean not even once! No complete toylet. Theres no lavatory on the ground floor. ,5.4
Everything was good the stuff is really friendly and we had breakfast in bed .. fantastique ,9
The breakfast was excellent! A real treat to start your day. ,9
The location of the apartment was central and right next to the beach.A spacious apartment with plenty of room for 4 people.Nice view design and clean flat. The pillows were really bad and uncomfortable and sadly so the beds as well. Little to hard for our preference.Checking in was a little unusual. the reception was closed so you had to call a number after 4 o clock so basically you checked yourself in. And no staff around for 2 days.Not much for customer service. ,7.9
The location cleanliness friendliness of the staff. The bedroom and bathroom felt cramped.,8
Excellent breakfast.  Tidy spacious room. Noice from cooling system? outside and delivery van in the morning.,8
Breskfast was very good! Good Location and nice staff! Tunfortunateley the room was not very clean:( construction work right in front of our room so very noisy in the morning..,5.8
Breakfast breakfast and breakfast. Exceeded all my expectations! ,10
Lots of space very clean nice contemporary design great tasty breakfast perfect location A bit noisy because of the road works,9.2
Excellent breakfast friendly staff and nice location! I have visited alreay several times and will surely come back a.s.a.p. Try their pancakes and their bakery! ,9.6
Modern renovated apartment tasty breakfast included proximity to beach availability of free parking nearby. ,10
Just about perfect: location room amenities hospitality. What we really liked is that breakfast is optional as the location included a bakery/patisserie and tea room of the highest quality. So youbcan breakfast whenever you want and compose something that will satisfy your cravings. If not YOU really have a problem.  That you cant put your feet into the see during breakfast! Oh ok just joking! ,10
The receptionist was very nice although the property reception was closed by the time we arrived he showed up right in 5 minutes after the call Apartment is not well thought and lacks comfort due to pretentiousness for the contemporary style. Toilet is in the first and shower on the second floor. Imagine you need to use a toilet at night. You can hardly fit in the shower cabin. Sofa has stains from previous visits apartment rules foils are all greasy blankets have some hair on it. I am absolutely not happy with this offering maximum price is 100$ per night.,5.8
Very central location. Walking distance to all the attractions. Kitchen facilities. Quieter than expected at least on a weekday. Good value for money. Small bed for two people to sleep. Smelly bathroom. Very slow check-in. Poor sound insulation. You can hear people walking upstairs. Have to reconnect to Wifi every now and then.,6.7
Location. Hard to find since there is no signboard,9.6
Beautiful spacious apartment in a very good location. The noise. We knew it was above a restaurant but we were still suprised by just how loud it was.,8.3
Fabulous flat great location would definitely stay again. ,10
very central for exploration of liege the entrance staircase !,9.6
Actual person who checked us in was pleasant. Kitchen was well equipped to prepare small meal. Slow check in staff rude when came in. Noisy from bar below. Sewage smell in bathroom. Plug socket coming out of wall. Very tight access up spiral staircase. Bed mattress too hard. ,5.8
Easy walk from railway station surrounded by bars restaurants and quiet The stairs up to the apartment tricky to negotiate with a bag,8
The hotel is in an excellent location for going to the European Parliament which was suitable for a short stay in Brussels for a few days. Breakfast is packaged due to the coronavirus epidemic alone which has a rather limited selection.,9
Great location you can get to the centre and european quarter by foot to get to more distant places you can take a subway which is 3 minutes from the hotel. Staff is very friendly and helpful always does its best to answer your questions. The rooms were clean and were equipped with everything you need. I would recommend this place to everyone who intends to see Brussels.   ,9.6
Relatively spacious apart hotel for 3-4 people. Separate kitchenette with table chairs fridge microwave and 2 cooking plates. Beds were comfortable hotel quiet.Near to a bus 95 direct to a Grand Place in 10-15 minutes. Also 5 minutes walk to Trone metro and a supermarket. There is no hotel car park. But plenty of street parking available and can pay for a ticket for 24 hours.,8.3
The small cooking space A bit far from mrt or eateries,7.1
I booked the hotel for my parents while I stayed somewhere else. I like the studios in Aparthotel Adagio (I already stayed in one of their studios in Strasbourg) because they give you the possibility to put beverages in the fridge and use glasses and forks so you feel a little bit more at home in this hotel. Everything was clean and the bathroom was very beautiful. I asked the hotel to get breakfast together with my parents and they booked and additional breakfast for me without any problems. I can totally recommend this hotel. ,8.3
Perfect location very close to Parlament and only 10 minutes walking distance from the center. Very safe neighbourd! All recomendations for the hotel!! Clean and friendly ,10
The mini-shop with food and drinks at the reception is a great idea! ,10
Staff was friendly and helpful breakfast is okay everything I needed was there but nothing special It all looks a bit old and used they rennovated the breakfast room during the stay.  I know its the European Quarter and everything but 140 $ per night is not justified in any way.,6.3
I really liked the second room when I changed (not on the street and larger) The 3 first nights were not really comfortable as the room was not quiet and I smelled cigarette smoke (I am allergic and have breathing problems). Happily thanks to the kind staff I could change the room for the last 2 days.,7.1
Nice personnel breakfast was ok. Room was old walls long time ago should be repainted. For this price you could expect much more.,7.1
Close to the center of the city the subway and the Central Shuman and Luxembourg railway station. The staff was very friendly It is not specified that the accommodation has rooms on semi-basement the price being the same regardless of the floor. I get such a room with relatively high humidity for 5 days of accommodation. Carpet on the floor does not help against mold. The windows had only a simple opening system. Good luck we use the camera just for sleep bad luck that after a day with the closed window in the evening was a pretty unpleasant smell in the room.,7.1
Ive really liked the hotels location: its very close to the city center and the old town. In 5 mins walk you can easily get to the Royal Palace and the park. Metro station Trone is in 100m distance from the hotel entrance. I didnt like that the cleaning service wasnt included in the whole payment of staying. We needed to pay extra if we needed to clean the room.,7.1
I like adagios apartments with equipped kitchen. We stay in hotel 7 nights and there isnt rooms cleaning services change towels and bed sheets. every morning was same breakfast. The staff didnt help us to change booked rooms and we pay for  one room extra.,5
Nice staffs I requested 2 singles bed but I got 1 queen bed. Theres obstruction of the drain in shower room.,8.3
Good apartment hotel well situated for government sector of Brussels. Really friendly helpful staff. Clean good size room comfortable beds. Continental breakfast did the job. I will use this hotel again and would recommend for business travel in this part of Brussels. ,9
very friendly and welcoming staff clean room and bathroom comfortable bed salt oil and coffee filters in the kitchen would be a nice idea. There is a small store at the reception where you can buy some basics but no tea or tea bags,8
The hotel is great you have all that you need. All devices to cook or warm meal in your room. Pleasant and very helpful staff amazing breakfasts where you can even prepare Belgium waffles :-) ,10
Great location comfortable room close to public transport and good for self catering. May not charge in Euros unless you specify when booking.,9.2
Nice quiet aparthotel Evening meals as nothing much nearby,7.1
Location is good as it is near EU buildings and the surroundings is quite in the evening and during the night. The personnel was extremely nice and helpful. The smell in the room was bad from the day 1. Because of that I decided not to cook inside as I did not want to make it worse. I also did not like that you need to pay for extra clean towels and to tidy up the room.,7.1
The localisation and the staff The bed for 2 prs is very small and the room was not very clean,7.5
Nice staff great location good breakfast room a bit small (in particular desk and dining table),9.2
Everything was perfect. Very good room comfortable beds very clean friendly and attentive staff to our requests. We will come back with pleasure! ,9.6
Location is excellent for a business trip and especially if you are working with EU institutions.  If as a tourist it is not such a long walk to the main sights such as Grand Place Traffic noise might be a problem in some rooms but this not something that the hotel can do anything about,9.2
It is great that they have the little shop on the ground floor where you can buy quick snacks and drinks! ,7.9
Spacious modern room with everything you need for a short term stay. The kitchenette is only basically equipped so not for more than a two week stay. Internet although was high speed still was of low quality with it dropping out regularly. The room itself was very nice but the smallest TV on the wall didnt make sense..Kitchenette needs more utensils and pans.,7.5
Great Breakfast reception staff really friendly ,8.8
The customer service is excellent very kind and helpful information ,9.6
Good location comfy room with enough facilities.  Its all OK just the shower is slightly too small. ,9.2
Convenient location Unpolite staff the room was smelling,5
1. very helpfull staff 2. Quick Internet without login problems 3. good breakfast 4. nice spacious room :) .,10
Breakfast was very good the quality of breads excellent good selection of cheese and ham. Staff was very cheerful and courteous. Construction near eating area was a negative factor- noise and dust.  When renovation is complete the lobby/eating area will be spacious and pleasant - but not there yet. Carpeting in the apartment should be replaced. TV signal was missing repairs did not fully restore system after 4 days.,7.1
- The downstairs reception area was bright and cheerful.  - The staff were all helpful and polite.   - The location was relatively convenient: perhaps only 10 - 15 minutes to walk to the city centre.  But the Aparthotel Adagio Access is towards the EU quarter and gusts should be prepared for a degree of traffic noise. -It is a bit of a stretch to call this an Aparthotel simply by virtue of putting a small sink and a two-ring hob at the end of what was otherwise an entirely ordinary hotel room.  - The accommodation is very basic.  It was convenient for a few days longer would have been difficult,6.7
The room was nice and warm! The kettle in my room was broken and there was no electrical socket in the kitchenette.,8.3
Room was lovely and quiet.  Kitchen facilities good. Lovely spacious bathroom. Nothing,10
The only good thing is the location because its close to the city center. The bathroom was not clean. We found hair from previous stays. You need to pay for have your towels changed. It smelled like food at arrival. The boiler was quickly empty so we had to wait until it was filled again with hot water which we didnt know or made aware of.,3.8
Almost everything just a couple of small points - see below Would be useful to have a safe in the room and the room is a little expensive but OK,9.2
Spacious room friendly staff very good location No tea bags in room although kirchenette was available.,9.6
Clean place very friendly staff very good breakfast they had a nice welcoming beer + chocolate in the room :) Not enough organic products at breakfast,9
 Kitchen corners fluorescent lamp.. not nice at all during the night,8
The receptionists were fantastic. They let me check-out a few hours later than 11AM as I had an appointment at an Embassy of which I didnt know how long itd take so that was really kind. No minibar,9
Very well located Very small bed for 2,5.8
The aparthotel delivers a very practical and useful offering in a prime location for access to certain European institutions. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Minor problems (like a non-functioning  room card in my case) are dealt with in exemplary fashion. ,9.2
almost everything was great: staff was friendly and helpful rooms cozy and warm location just awesome. great value for money. I found someones hair under the sheet (on the mattress) - cleaning could be more thorough. No vegetables for breakfast.,9.6
Friendly staff. Nice light open room. Well equipped. Two chairs and a desk for working. A bit close to Rue Belliard which is a very busy road although the double glazing was good. ,9.2
Really nice rooms/apartments for a stay in Brussels. The rooms are big and with everything you need for a short-medium stay. ,9
 I stayed for 4 nights and at the and the bathroom became quite dirty and towels as well. If the person stays longer than 2 night it would be nice to clean the property.,7.9
The employees were very helpful patient and kind. The rooms were tidy and contained a small kitchen with a fridge and microwave. Very well equipped. So we could bring something to the hotel to eat. That was perfect. We could choose the floor we wanted to be on. The windows could be opened. I simply dont get it that there is no person taking out the trash or changing the towels if you stay less than 7 days. When we wanted clean towels we were helped kindly but we had a lot of trash and it just piled up in the corner. The air conditioner switched itself off after a little while so we woke up bathing in our own sweat..,8.3
I loved the location! It was a few minutes from a big park and just a few more minutes from the city center. The ladies and gentlemen at the front desk were absolutely amazing and friendly! They helped me so much on my stay I cant thank them enough. Also there is a washing and drying machine on the property which is super convenient. The plugs are type c and I had no idea they would be different! The coolest part is the front desk people were able to give me an adapter. There was seriously nothing bad about this hotel!,10
Location perfect. Never had breakfast No internet for half the stay,9
easygoing place bathroom drainage is bit blocked,10
Very good location in the European District easy to get there. Quickly check-in. The room was cozy and clean and is for the very first time when I can sleep from the first night in an unknown place. Its not like I would not have liked something it just because in one night was a little noise cause near the location was paved a street. But not something to disturb our holidays.,9.6
everything friendly service excellent location quiet although it is located in one of the busiest streets in Brussels ,9
Staff very friendly and helpful Quiet part of the city on a Sunday,8
Location easy access with 24h reception. Very basic and small rooms.,7.1
Breakfast was more then enough  Near all the beautiful sites of Brussels ,9
Wonderful location excellent breakfast. The traffic at Belliard str. starts early in the morning and it is a bit noisy if you plan to stay the whole day in your room. if that is you case ask for a room with other view.,9.2
Room and barhroom larger than in Ibis friendly staff 24 hr reception still withim walking distance to meeting At least for the first night/morning there could be free tea bags and Chiffre for 1 cup in the minishop downstairs tea was not available a small selection of small boxes of teabags and Instant coffe bags would be nice more food variety that can be purchased and check of expiry dates would be helpful. The floor of the lift was quite dirty. The variety of ham/cheese and egg dishes is quite poor the lady is very nice though. The desk in the room is very small for 3 Nights ok but for more?,7.1
Location breakfast room everything. Too soft mattress for my taste.,9.6
Excellent localization everything went well.  ,10
Great staff good location and comfort beds. Five days without any clean room service.,7.1
The aparthotel is close to metro stations also is conveniently most attractions by bus. Staffs were nice. The hot water did not work well. We stayed for 3 nights I was the 2nd one to take the hot shower but unluckily the hot water suddenly turned cold after the hair shampoo for two times. I have advised to the reception staffs on the 1st and during check out. They both advised if 1st guest takes a hot shower the 2nd guests have to wait for 45 mins to heat the water. Its really frustrated.  There are less stores and restaurants near the aparthotel its recommend to have the dinner at city center before returning the aparthotel.,7.5
Location is good just too noisy by car to my room Never see you pay for clean your beedroom and to pay for change tower .,3.8
Staff are very friendly convenient amenities in lobby.  5min-15min walk to main areas. Quiet location easy to find.  The walls and carpets had stains/marks.  There is an additional charge to freshen the room (change towels). The room has a kettle but no tea sachets filters or coffee.,7.1
Very good economy hotel in Brussels located very close to the EU Parliament. ,9
We had originally booked the same hotel but in Brussels Schuman station. Due to Covid restriction they moved us to the Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel in the center for the same price and the situation went way beyond our expectations. Very central and very convenient location for visiting all the main attractions of Brussels apartment equipped with all the desirable needs even for cooking something friendly staff. Sofa-bed and no change of towels and sheets for the entire stay (3 nights),8
Everything! The location was excellent for my meeting. Shower had a tendency to leak water on the floor.,10
No breakfast was available because of the lockdown otherwise everything was fantastic The location,9
All perfect.New very confortable apartments close to EU institutions.Very gentle and efficient staff.250 mt from airport bus (nb 12) stop and supermarkets.Possible to buy (slightly overprized) food at receprion. ,10
The room is simple but very clean quiet at a convenient location (walking distance from Grand Place Parliament and restaurants). Staff is very helpful and friendly. Good price for Brussels. Great wifi.  Nothing,9.6
Great location (15 minutes to Central station and Grand Place via park). Friendly staff.  The room is big clean.Small kitchen in the room its very comfortable.  Cleaning service for extra charge,9.6
Very good location very helpful staff and welcoming snacks were perfect :) ,9.6
The stafd vere nice and helpful the bed was good clean bathroom. The booking.com photos show a beautiful new facility while I was gratly dissapointed to see a dirty carpet flooring with ugly wall platering and a very small apartment with the bed immediately next to the kitchen sink and microwave all at 595$ for the five night stay! I have never been more conned into a high priced stay and we had to pay immediately even before we saw the rooms. To change your towels you had to add 2.5$ like this was not enough. And the location was not in the center or the EU district but three metro stations either way. Very dissapointed would never recommend this as opposed to many other beautiful places in Brussels for the same price!,5
Bed was really comfortable and I asked for a quiet room the staff were really obliging and looked after me. I had a great sleep. ,10
Great hotel fantastic friendly and helpful staff! Breakfast was also really nice. I will come back for sure. ,8.8
I especially liked the staff! I would say they were the highlight of the stay. I think it may be a little overpriced. 10$ for the breakfast provided was a bit steep. For a two star hotel 130$ is a bit overpriced. But I understand Belgium is an expensive place so I understand. I would still stay there if I got to come back.,9.2
Great receptionists near everything.  So yes 5 for this hotel  ,10
Friendly staff. Convenient location. Very quiet at night. ,8.8
very good breakfast plenty of choice. we arrived early and did not expect the hotel to have a room available for us but they said give us 10 minutes and we will have a room available for you. and they did !  we were able to leave our bags in a safe room on the final day of our stay and collect later no fresh milk with the breakfast.,10
Great location- us for me. Very friendly staff. And you dont have to search for a shop in the evening everything is on-site just next to front desk :) nothing,9
The neighborhood The fact that we were staying there four days and the towels were never changed and the room was never cleaned. And when we asked it the hotel say we had to pay for that service.,6.7
Good location. Balcony on the floor 7. The bed is 1.4 m not enough comfortable for two people. There is no daily cleaning included in the price.,6.7
The staff was pleasant and helpful. Spoke and understood English extremely well. Room was overly hot. It was advertised as located in the city center it wasnt.,5
Not much can be added the building itself and the apartment units are very well maintained and and cleaned properly. All the equipment of the kitchen unit and the electronics were spotless and so was the bathroom.The staff is extremely friendly polite and speaks several languages. The check-in/out time could be adjusted and and be a little more generous.,10
Nice to stay Very cold room  Cold air coming from windows,7.1
its close to centar and metro Its not clean its dark in the room and big noise from street,6.7
Good location comfy bed good value for money. Staff very friendly and gave us access to another room when our shower had no hot water. It was over 5 euro for a Coke and a tea no teabags in the room. Floor was slightly dirty in the room.,7
 One towel was really really dirty and that ruined it for me.,6.3
Excellent location and facilities but the best in this hotel is the service provided by the local staff. Superb!!! ,9
Everyrhing was good. We enjoyed very much our stay. Nothing,10
1st time in this place and very positively surprised. Good offers on food and refreshments in the lobby very friendly service. Location close to Parlament quiet room and very affordable in comparison. ,9.2
I liked ease of check in and check out calmness of the room possibility to make a tea. There is also nice lobby. I did not try the breakfast. Satisfied. ,9.2
Only the staff who was very nice  It was cat fish The pictures were from their sister property and we had too little time and just an overnight stay so no time to change for another property ,3.8
Good location supermarket and other shops close by.  The shower curtain sticky challenge to keep the floor dry. ,7.9
Good sized room quiet. No tea or coffee in the room though a kettle was there.,8
Great location. The center accessible by walking. Metro station 300m from hotel. Tasteful breakfast. Really helpful staff at reception. We appreciated a small kitchen in our room. Excellent choice for the money IMO. ,9
Good location for walking to meetings and for shops / parks at the weekend. The room was well lit with a good working space. Comfortable bed. There was quite a lot of road traffic from Rue Bailliard. Next time I will ask for a quieter room. Additional clothes for washing and drying dishes would have been useful. Perhaps I should have asked!,10
Friendly and helpful personel Discomfort pillows,9.2
It was sufficient and location is great closed to everything. nothing,9.6
The staff was really nice and helpful even when I had some issues at arrival due to a flight cancellation. The hotel is well located and comfortable. ,8.8
Breakfast was worth the money room was very nice. Lobby shop had everything you could need. Very helpful and friendly polite staff!  Nice fresh decor. Our room was located just on top of the outdoor which caused some noise but the staff was very willing to change the room - we had just unpacked everything so changing wasnt really an option. The staff also talked with the guests hanging out outside which solved the problem.  The aircon in the room was fine with the temperature control also made it warmer. The only thing affecting the comfortability was the smell. There was a bit stuffy smell in the room mostly due to the carpet flooring. The aircon flters might also needed to check a bit more frequently.,8.3
Nice apartment clean rooms comfortable quiet. Friendly staff. Great location (15 minutes to Central station and Grand Place via park).  Small kitchen in the room its very comfortable. Cleaning service for extra charge,9.2
While its hidden a bit among some boring city architecture and not by any measure in the middle of anything its pretty conveniently located - easy walking to main train stations public transit shopping and food parks and playgrounds. Breakfast is respectable. Food for purchase in the lobby is reasonable. Would be nice if there was a proper grocery with fresh produce in the block.,7.5
Very cosy nice having a little kitchenette mattresses excellent cleaning also great. staff very helpful and very nice Breakfast area is often crowded and noisy since it is close to entrance and no separation from lobby.,8.8
The rooms are very clean the staff is kind and ready to help there is reception open 24h a day. They have a small kitchen in every room - with coffee machine and the water heater and in the lounge there is also a small store where you can buy some food to prepare then in the room. The fact that I was not able to connect to the Wifi. but I was using my mobile internet then during the stay. IF I would ask they would probably help.,10
The staff is extremely friendly and supportive. They are the true asset of the Hotel. Perfect location ,9.6
Comfortable room good breakfast very nice staff. The location was also very good very close to the museums Royal Palace and Central Station.  Good public transport connections as well. Price seemed a bit high.,9.6
Great location super helpful and polite staff.  Good kitchen utencils and opportunity to prepare basic food. Very good breakfast! easy to take any transport especially bus and metro. Very close to the European Parliament and easy to take bus 12 to the airport! very important if one has luggage and does not want to take taxi! The fact that they clean only after the guest leaves the accomodation (end of stay).,8
Great location for Government sector. Close to Metro. Nice size room. Good kitchen area if you wanted to eat in Handy shop in lobby. Comfortable bed. Good Hot shower. Was very clean. Very friendly staff. Buffet continental breafast did the job. I will be staying here again. ,10
Price is cheaper than many other hotels. The bedsheets were clean. I would pay more for a better hotel. we get only what we pay. The bed is small. The drain of the shower room was blocked. The staff service was not so professional.,6.7
Friendly staff The location is a little bit far away from center.,6.7
The location is about 20 minutes walk from the main centre through a lovely park.Little cafe in the foyer with a pizza oven selling sandwiches snacks and pizza.They let us store our bags all day when leaving.  Nothing,9.6
I was travelling for business and working until late every evening. Having a comfortable apartment where I could prepare food late at night plus have cold drinks was ideal. Bedroom etc. was also very comfortable. Nothing!,10
Only booked as Ypres was totally booked out. Very close in a quiet pretty town.  Very modern and clean.  Only 15 minutes to Ypres. Not much,10
Beautiful place. Great value Didnt sleep too well. A bit noisy on main road . Just need to sort decent pillows.,9.6
Our apartment was beautifully equipped and spotlessly clean and cared for. The staff who we met were friendly efficient and incredibly helpful throughout our stay and really made us welcome. The location in Flanders is perfect for touring the beautiful towns of Ieper and Poperinghe and very close to all of the major Great War museums battlefields memorials and places of interest. Kemmel village itself is a beautiful lively and friendly place well equipped with places to eat and drink and to buy provisions. We will definitely stay here next time we visit Flanders. We could not fault the accommodation staff or the location.,10
Everything looks good Inadequate staff,7.5
Lovely modern apartments with all mod cons We arrived very late and the caretaker was pretty frosty with us throughout our stay- Shame he lacked charisma,9.6
More spacious than expected . Nearby Woods bakery and bars. Perfect place for cycling and walks. ,10
The apartment was very smart clean and warm. I cannot praise the service from the owners enough. They were very friendly and helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Nothing that I could see,10
A lovely apartment for a family stay near Ypres. Large clean and attractive. The owners are friendly and helpful. Wed definitely stay again if we return to the area. ,10
The hotel was well located. The room was spacious and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was tasty and substantial. The food in the restaurant was excellent. The bathroom was light on toiletries. We couldnt figure out the heating.,9.2
Cleanliness first rate  bed comfy shower room awesome. Restaurant pricey.,9.2
As a child I grew in a neighbouring village.  The people at Trilogie were very friendly and helpful.  We couldnt have chosen a better place to stay during our visit.  The location at the village of Kemmel close to a local food shop and restaurants and a visitor centre is ideal. There wasnt a place in the bedroom to put a suitcase on.,10
Very good food in the restaurant and excellent breakfast. Nothing,10
The couple were very kind and helpful. Each day asked that everything was OK. Could not do enough for us. Plenty of bars and restaurants near by and good for touring the the WW graves. Apartment 4 was fantastic even though one had to climb twisty stairs to get to it bed very comfortable. Nothing,10
We were very well received by the host who was very nice. He explained a little bit of the history of Ieper. Much information about the zone was in the apartment. ,7.9
Very clean and comfortable apartment would highly recommend. ,9.6
Everything was what we wanted for our vacation. Lovely and clean accommodation.  Dries was very helpful with the booking and arranging everything for us.,10
The apartment is situated in a really nice location close to shops and restaurants and only 5 miles from Ypres. Parking is free outside the front door and the owner meets you to handover and hand back the keys. The double bed is comfy and the sofa bed is ok as well. The kitchenette is well equipped and the bathroom has a very good shower. the whole place is modern and also has AC. Nothing,10
Lovely well maintenaned clean apartment conveniently located for visiting WW1 cemeteries Ypres and Brugge by car.  ,10
comfortable and spacious apartment. local supermarket within 100m plenty of parking spaces near by. great location for visiting WW1 sites. ,10
Air con in each room convenient free parking local shops communication with property owner size of apartment. Having to pay extra for towels.,9.2
The location was very good. Close to center but quiet. Some of the inventory could use a brush-up. But nice and clean!,8.8
The house was comfortable and close to the medieval central. ,7.9
it is nice and clean place with cosy living area really close to the center well equiped kitchen and shops and restaraunts nearby one of bedrooms is located in a separate building in the backyard - that was not indicated in the property description also there was no wi-fi connection in this bedrom,7
The rooms are comfortable and suitable for family with kids or travelling with friends. The kitchen was very clean very well equipped you can find all you need for cooking. There are coffee machines also as coffee/tea provided by hosts.  The tram (number 4 ) is easily reachable just around the corner thus to go to the train station is very easy At least a small piece of soap or shower gell would be very much appreciated as when you arrive very late in the evening and those things are not available it could be problematic. There are no cafes nearly for getting breakfast or dinner you need to take a walk to the city center,9.2
Very nice location walking distance from the city centre and our conference venue. Very comfortable well equipped apartment modern kitchen with all features you could wish for and very friendly host. If I ever visit Ghent again I will certainly check this apartment out again. No problems whatsoever,10
Safe clean and walking distance to tram and to town Stairs in the studio to the bedroom was steep. Would not have been suitable for young people or people with mobility issues,9.6
For me the location was perfect (close both to work and the city center). The rooms are clean and it is very quiet there during nights. There is everything ready in the kitchen if you need to prepare a meal for yourself or your friends and you brought the main ingredients. Nothing comes to my mind at the moment.,9.6
Really nice comfortable and clean flat. Excellent provision of equipment for the kitchen. Hosts were quick to reply and made no fuss addressing our needs. Wonderful.  Nothing really I cannot really fault it. ,10
I like the interior of the house. Everything is complete. The internet is really slow,8.8
 Shower head was not there.. really not practical and not nice to take a shower.  Rooms far too small (no space around the bed). Two single beds are 80 cm width.. good for a small kid but not comfortable for a teenager.,5
Great apartment great location. Nothing!!,10
 Rooms are separated by a yard. Important to know when traveling with small kids.,9.6
Location decoration and facilities. Bedrooms are really warm during summer. There are ventilators but only help a little. Also there were many musquitos. Previous visitors also dealt with them because we saw many blood stains on the walls :),7.9
The location was great just a short walk from the centre of town.  The apartment was very clean and well equipped with tea and coffee and even a few chocolate eggs. It would be helpful if the host provided information about collection of the keys.  It would be great if there was a kettle in the apartment.,9.2
Location  what a place  in the middle of leper  near museums  cloth store and restaurants would recommend to friends  and family Nothing,10
Super location clean milf in the fridge & wine on the table Smashing beds! ...err???      cant thinks of anything.,10
The apartment was excellentThe owners were welcoming and friendly and had even put milk and water in the fridge for us. The apartment had been finished to a high standard with en suite shower facilities etc in both bedrooms.There is satellite tv plus full kitchen facilities there was even a washing machine and dishwasher. The location is excellent it was about a 2-4 minute walk from the cloth house.The owners had even provided a filter coffee machine with coffee and filters. You honestly couldnt ask for more and I will certainly book there if I go back.I would highly recommend the aurora apartments to anybody looking to visit Ypres. Nothing the apartment was perfect,10
Excellent apartment for my partner and friends. Will 100% be going back. ,10
The house was nice and central and everything was within walking distance.  There was plenty of room for the 4 of us.  The house was fully equipped and to a high spec.  The outside area was an added bonus It was a shame there wasnt a toilet in the 3rd floor bathroom for the 2 double bedrooms up there.,10
great location very friendly host well stocked kitchen very clean and comfortable  apartment. Didnt dislike anything although a curtain in the lounge would have made it feel a little cosier .,10
Liked all the little extra touches about the apartment .the owners have given it a feel of home from home .would definitely stay there again . Nothing .,10
apartments ideally located in the centre of town. Well kitted out kitchens with everything there for self catering even though many restaurants locally One of the apartments had a lot of steep stairs. Not ideal for everyone because of this. otherwise perfect,9.2
Great location. Modern decoration and very clean. Great views. Fantastic communication and Karin made us very welcome - couldnt fault it Nothing - perfect,10
Great location lovely apartment containing everything that we needed. Lovely and clean and bright. We would recommend without hesitation and would return. Hosts were friendly and helpful and collection and drop off of keys was easy. ,10
Karin was the perfect host so friendly and helpful. We took advantage of the private parking which was great. The location could not be better and the apartment was perfect for the three of us. Excellent stay. Nothing,10
There wasnt anything to dislike! Karin was at the property on arrival she was so helpful & friendly as there was 13 there were no problems whatsover the accommodation was just lovely clean & inviting the location was perfect just a few minutes walk to the Grote Markt we were in Ypres to enjoy the weekend of cycling beer & fun the accommodation was just the icing on the cake! Highly Recommended! Thanks Karin! Nothing!,10
Very clean and comfortable even though its near the main square it wasnt noisy at nights.   Nothing every thing was great,10
First class accommodation  -  without fault. Owners welcoming and helpful. Small details like milk water and beer! in the fridge I couldnt find fault in anything,10
Location was superb property was exactly what we needed and was plenty big enough for six adults  There wasnt anything we didnt like!,10
Host available when we needed her. Great location although a little noisy (building work started before 7am which seemed a bit much). Lovely comfy beds and plenty of pillows and towels even toiletries if needed. Well equipped kitchen and plenty of space. Central location. The building work started early but wont go on long I suspect. Bit noisy when cars went past but the central location more than made up for this. Lovely to stay somewhere on a par with our family home.,9.2
 Modern Clean great hosts amazing location.,10
Super friendly hosts sincere and helpful. ,9.6
Karen the owner was there everyday and if you needed anything she would get it there and then the place was spotless  it had everything you wanted or needed very friendly and helpful yes this is a place you should stay nothing it was all there for you,10
A very nice welcomegreat location for touring the local sites ,10
Convenient location easy access and communication with owner secure garage available.  Warm apartment neat and stylish with everything needed for short stay.  Immaculate furnishings and cleanliness showed care from owner. Lovely touch with wine beer milk and water in fridge. Close to all amenities but still very quiet and peaceful in apartment. Tourist information in apartment. Will definitely be back.   Nothing.,10
Excellent location in the heart of Brussels!!! The host (Philippe) was great and helpful. The apartment was clean and modern ,10
Central situated the 2 bedrooms apartment was in the middle of town very clean and beautiful view. I truly recommend and for sure we will return. ,10
good positio WIFI and heater are excellent. ,10
Very clean comfortable secure and spacious apartment with full kitchen. Location is perfect within walking distance to shopping dining bars metro train and sites. It may be an issue with some to have late night partying noise outside. We were okay with it.,10
Philippe was very helpful met us with keys showed us how everything worked etc ,10
Was quite big in the center of Bruxelles next to Grand Place and embassies parking at no more than 3 walk. Very good for whom wants to visit the center of Bruxelles easily. ,8
Location fabulousVery cleanEverything works in the apartmentPretty perfect really.  Residents above were a little noisy. $30 extra for late check-in should be clearer in booking site.,10
Very good location comfortable and clean nice and helpful owners. ,10
Nice apartment right in the center of the city.Super clean! market right around the corner with all that you would need to enjoy the apartment.  For us having to go into the Small mall to access the apartment located above the mall was unusual but we managed. We still enjoyed the apartment and location!,8.8
The apartment was in the city centre clean as shown on pictures. The heating was quite loud in bedroom.,9.6
The location was great ‚Äî the entrance was in the middle of a mall ‚Äî but the inside of the place was great. Parking was not very easy. Garage only and then a 300 yard walk to property.,9.6
Everything! Location was perfect! Right in the heart of the city! Squeaky clean! Paid parking garage to use was super close and we left our car their the duration of our stay so no need to drive anywhere! And I liked the security. I felt completely safe and I was not worried about my belongings while running around the city. I would stay again and again at this place! Nothing!,10
A very clean and cosy apartment located in the heart of Brussels. Very good hospitality aswell. Great experience. ,9
The location is perfect Everything was good,10
Very spacious and helpful staff. Just the entrance a bit complicated at night when the main one is closed.,8
The location was excellent it was so close to the city and Phillipe was very helpful and nothing was too much for him we were able to leave our luggage on checkout day so that was a big bonus not to have to carry it around all day as we had an evening flight. Would definitely stay there again. Could have had more sockets in the kitchen area but we managed when cooking breakfast.,9.2
Spacious for 4 people fully equipped kitchen ideal location in the city center where all shops restaurants and markets are within a walking distance (no need for  a car) Bathroom standards is unfortunately less than expected when you compare it with an almost 9 out of 10 rating: i mean here the toilet room is too tight and the toilet papers have no hanger!  The bathtub doesnt drain the water quickly in case you want to take a shower. Plus a pipe supposed to be for a washing machine is only blocked with a pack of napkins!,8.8
the position was great and the apartment was good equipped. ,8
Central location - close to historic and cultural centre markets and supermarkets. Good WiFi. Clean spacious and quiet apartment. Comfortable and well-equipped even with coffee-machine. ,9
Apartment was so central and excellent location.  Apartment was very clean and beds very comfortable.  Phillipe was very helpful to us. ,8.8
Big and spacious.  This apartment was EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAN and a great value in Brussels.  If given the chance to stay here again I would not hesitate to do so.  The staff was also very nice. I have nothing negative to say about our experience.,10
Phillippe is very helpfull and best apartment host so far. Great location but little bit noisy at night because its next to pub. ,9.2
probably location will be the best in Brussels. There must be a trouble on plumbing. The water didnt go down well while taking a shower.,8.8
Close to several great dining shopping and entertainment venues this apartment was neat and clean- not to mention the genuinely kind and friendly host! ,10
Clean apartment communicative host and good location  ,10
Location is really good and the host provided a lot of useful information prior to arrival. Check in and check out process is easy. Host allowed early check in which was really appreciative since I was travelling with senior citizens and small baby. The drainage in the shower room was blocked. Contacted the host to inform of the situation but did not get any respond. Not everyone able to have shower at the same time as it takes up to 2 hours for the water to clear. We didnt want the water to overflow the shower room so sometimes we had to skip shower session.,7.9
Perfect location and super easy and flexible check-in / check-out! ,9.2
It is a big apartment in the very center of Brussels. The apartment was clean well equipped with bed sheet set towels kitchen towel hygiene products. Also the kitchen is well equipped and everything is functioning. We were there with 2 adults  2 adolescents but the apartment is big enough for 6 persons when using the large and easy to handle bed couch in the living room. The apartment is very safe: during the day there are 2 locking doors and at night 3 locking doors. Philippe and Esmara are very friendly. At night it is very noisy but if you close the double-glazed windows you hear almost nothing.,9
Location is really perfect for the centre. Just across two streets you are at the Grand place. At the same time it is well connected with metro and tram near the stop De Brouckere.  Lift is a plus as it was the apartment on the last floor. The only thing was the noise b the neighbouring apartments. May be the walls are not good as isolation when it is up to the talk within the other apartments. The hosts was really supportive - I told them and the second night it was quite.,8.8
Great location the room was spacious the bed was comfy kitchen are sufficiently equipped. Philippe was really attentive. There is limitation on the check in time so may be not the best choice if your arrive late.,10
Excellent apartment clean well located well equipped.Thanks Philippe!!!! We really appreciate your help and your kindness! For people like you we will have a better world. Nothing! All was perfect!!!!,10
Very clean apartment located I. A very central location. I definitely recommend it! ,10
Very near to supermarket shops restaurants etcApartment is cleaned  Nothing,8.3
The apartment is clean and with good facilities. The apartment has the best placement for a holiday in Brussels. Close to everything you need for an excellent vacation. A little problem in The bathroom. The room must have a better ventilation! There are some problems with mold not serious but not in very long time if you do not find a better ventilation solution they will appear soon,8.8
Fast check in responses easy to leave the keys when check out. The host was very helpful. The Internet (Wifi) speed was good enough but it sometimes disconnected to our devices.,9
Great location Would have been good to have coffee facilities.. there was tea provided but no coffee.,7.9
Excellent location large apartment quiet comfy bed Slightly tired decor that needs updating.,8
Everything was perfect.  Very cute  clean apartment. Nearby parking garage.  Right by the center ,10
Everything - the location was very central the quality of the apartment was outstanding and the entire experience was trouble free. Nothing to add here. The place is a gem.,10
Philippe was very friendly the apartment was in the middle of the city I strongly recommend the place. There could have been more lights installed in the bathroom.,10
Central location cleanliness friendly hosts. The toilet and the bathroom are separated and there is no sink in the toilet.,10
Location is ideal in the very center of Brussels. Friendly host. Nice modern room. ,9.6
Nice and cosy studio well situated. It was really easy to get the keys we just called and someone came immediately. The wifi wasnt working.,8.8
Perfect location in the center of town. Very nice apartment and very clean. They provided coffee creamer sugar tea. Nice patio in back. Parking was easy and close on underground lot had to pay for a few daytime  hours but overnight was free. ,10
Charming well equipped and very well positioned apartment with a nice private terrace. Water pressure in the bathroom was low  salt pepper oil and vinegar missing in the kitchen!  Otherwise perfect.,9
cosy and exquisitely decorated apartment set in an amazing location. beautiful terrace ,10
Apartment was spacious and comfortable. Coffee machine very good.  We left our bags as we arrived earlier than expected. We Tried calling ahead of time but language was a barrier. We accidentally saw another couple arriving and the owner going inside with them. After approaching him we were able to go to our room but it was very stressful not knowing what to do.  Shower water flow was very poor and there was  mould on grouting.,7.9
Really central location. Nice modern big apartment. ,9
Charming well equipped and very well positioned apartment. The shower room fittings need a little maintenance (many were loose and the lights over the shower didnt work properly). This would be very easy to resolve. Otherwise perfect.,9.6
Perfect location in the city center  apartment fully equipped. Couldnt have found a nicer apartment. Very cozy and the hosts very flexible about special requests. ,10
 Front door lock to the apartment you could not lock from the outside (faulty electronic lock) and the back French doors to the back courtyard could not be locked and one door had a broken hinge which meant that the apartment was totally insecure whilst I was out. Fix those two issues and its a great place to stay.,9.6
Perfect location in city centre marvelous terrace (apartments own terrace plus joint sun terrace for all 3 apartments) shops and restaurants within walking distance The inhouse decoration  has a special character (retro) and personal decoration items are present (e.g. retro objects books). River views. Check-in times very limited (16-17 h).  I had to renounce to a boat trip to Dinant because I would have arrived only at 19:00 then. When I arrived I was told on Sunday that the front door lock had been broken the day before and could only be fixed on Monday so everyone could walk into the house until then. But until I left on Wednesday it was not fixed.,8.3
Fantastic location right in the center of Dinant. Great appartment: roomy clean warm nicely decorated has all comfort including a dishwasher and a coffee machine.The owners were nice. Theres a map with nearby hikes on the wall. The bathroom smelled a bit upon our arrival and the shower needs some fixing but at least the water was warm. The bed takes some getting used to (it has a hard mattress).,8
Quirky apartment in the top of the building.  Very friendly helpful staff We were able to use the garage to store our bikes. ,9
Excellent location.  Lots of room & outdoor terrace Little Things missing - tea towels bath matt shower wash. Broken corkscrew. WiFi available but no internet. ,7.9
Excellent location right in the heart of Dinant next to the main attractions and restaurants.  Good wi-fi nice kitchen and bathroom facilities lovely back garden.  Although there was no parking available on the property free street parking was available nearby. It certainly wasnt the fault of the hosts that we were having a heat wave at the time.  But it was very difficult to sleep at night due to the temperature in the apartment.  There was no air conditioning and no fans available.  We left the windows open which didnt help much and also allowed in a lot of noise from the street.  We werent expecting air conditioning but some fans would have helped.,8
At arrival you have to call a gsm-number.  A friendly lady gives you the key-code of the house the same of your apartment. There are 4 apartments: 1 on the ground floor 2 on the 1st floor with terrace on the back and 1 on top (the largest without terrace). The proprietor is an art-gallery owner whos gallery is located next door. This house is designed in style with old furniture. No view of the riverboards (if terrace at the back). The bed is really hard not recommended for back sufferers! Stairs to do when youre not located on the ground floor.,8
Its the third time we come to Dinant and that we stay at Apartment Jules & Jim we love everything  ,10
For future visitors - the location and value for money is great.  VERY IMPORTANT: contact the host by phone about half an hour before your arrival because theres no reception desk or anything of the like. A basic knowledge of French will also be helpful. Enjoy! ,10
The location was good. The host ! I called beforehand to say I was going to arrive there late after calling 4 times someone finally picked up. When I arrived at the property I couldnt get in. Was not told the door code. Was not told what room I was in. Called many times. No-one answered. I spent 1 hour in the hallway trying to get in. Eventually other guests saw me and said they had the same problem so randomly took a room. 2 hours after Id arrived the owner finally got in touch.  His answer was oh well at least you didnt wait too long I was having dinner with friends this is not a hotel this was at almost 10pm I had a race the next day with an early start. So very very rude.,8.3
The sunroof the spacious apartment the very central location of the apartment the cleanliness.  The lack of good WiFi signal throughout the entire apartment. The water pressure in the bathroom was low the late check in time. ,7.9
The apartment was spacious beautifully decorated with kitchen facilities and room to relax. The outside area was just lovely. So central to everrythig and so quiet. The perfect place to discover Dinant.  ,10
Located right in the middle of Dinant. We walked everywhere. Easy check-in and parking nearby. Tap in the bathroom didnt quite work well. Shower was nice but needed to be held in hand. Used the bathtub instead :),8
Very central location to all historic sites within the town itself and not far by car/ cycle to sites outside the town. Apart facilities excellent for self catering. Bernard very helpful in getting us from train station outside Ypres after rail disruption late at night prevented us getting last train connection to Ypres. He was a delightful and helpful host and also agreed to take us to our next stopover in Dunkirk- saved us a long and cumbersome journey by public transport. Nothing we didnt like.,10
Fantastic location everything you need for a city break lovely and clean and a really good information/welcome book full of information about the surrounding area inc places to eat and prices etc. Would highly recommend but not for any one with mobility issues due to extremely steep staircase having to duck to go up and down.  The only negative I had was the pillows there are only 2 provided which are extremely soft and thin. My husband and I took up the 2 rather lumpy hard cushions from the armchairs to put underneath the pillow which didnt make much difference only gave me a terrible sore neck by the end of the stay. It needs better pillows and a couple of extra in the wardrobe for those who like more than one. ,9.6
Location 5 mns from centre. Bonus hiring bikes for 10 euro. Clean and tidy with adequate facilities for our stay no WiFi. Steep stairs thin pillows,8.3
Location clean Climbing the stairs a bit offputting,9.2
Decent cooking facilities although little room to prepare food. Good comfy chairs to relax in and table for eating at. Comfortable bed decent wardrobe space. Good information on local activities and services. Short walk to centre. Heating could take a while to heat up the space and then it could be a bit too warm. Steps to bedroom quite steep with no handrail one side very awkward having to bend to avoid ceiling halfway up. WiFi often poor.,8.8
Cleanspaciouswarm excellent location and good value. Stairs,10
Good location  Comfy bed Well equipped kitchen although some consumables would be handy like paper towel pepper oil Check in not available til 5pm ‚òπÔ∏è Very hot in downstairs lounge area in afternoons no opening windows. Bedroom upstairs also hot when windows are opened street/traffic noise is loud. Earplugs worked a treat. Would benefit from fans or a/c.  Steep narrow stairs need care. Apartment boasts washing machine and dryer they are available coin operated in a communal laundry City view is overstated actually not applicable.,7.1
Location excellent and lovely apartment. All you needed in apartment. It is quite noisy so difficult to sleep due to traffic on the cobbles. Also the pillows were really thin,9.5
Well positioned in town. Short walk to all places of interest. .,8.3
Suited our needs well. Well equipped and in a good location. Nothing really- stairs a bit steep but not really an big issue,9.6
Everything was readythe place was spotlessly clean and tidy bernard was here waiting and was a very good host with all the information you could need and a most friendly person . The local facilities are very good with plenty to see and doThe town is just a short walk away parking outside the property is easey . And free parking is avaliable just the other side of the menen gate All in all 10 out of 10 for sandpiper  There was nothing at all we didnt like,10
Warm cosy appartmentvery Ikea modern appearancegood locationfew minutes walk from the town and railway stationplenty of long stay free parking close by .The kitchen well equipped.Best supermarket 200yds behind the cloth hall Carifor.Few UK TV channels and the internet fast enough to stream TV. The stairs to the bedroom have been mentioned in previous reviews.I dont think they are any steeperjust more of them the sitting room ceilng is very highthey are ok if you are careful. On arrival I called the owner she was there within 5 minutes to welcome us. Nothing,9.6
The original apartment we reserved the Sandpiper was no longer available as the person renting it before us tested Covid positive.  The owner was quick to find a solution and offered us another apartment closer to the city at no extra cost.  The location was excellent very close to the city and the apartment was spacious enough for two people. I often like to make my own meals but there were no dishes available that could be used in the oven. Also the shower was very badly constructed and the doors did not close fully as a result while showering water spilled onto the bathroom floor .. which could prove to be dangerous if you are not paying attention and could have an accident by slipping on the wet floor.,8
The apartment is quirky  well equipped and well located. You need for nothing. The downstairs is open plan kitchen and sitting area with dining table and upstairs is spacious. Parking is street parking and we didnt seem to have a problem. The need to use a parking permit is normal throughout Ypres and will be explained to you on arrival.  There is nothing to dislike about the property however the stairs are steep and take some getting used to. So if your of poor mobility you may need to consider this.,9.6
The location is excellent with metro restaurants and supermarkets nearby. The kitchenet had everything you need and plus coffee and tea. Clean and spacious. The keys delivery was easy and so the hour you are arriving is not a problem! We recomend! It is the third floor without lift. It is a loft so you dont have much view. But there is enough light. In the bedroom upstairs it would be good to have some place to hang the clothes and/or store them. It is too nude just the bed and the lights.,9.4
Clean spacious fully equipped kitchen Bathroom is on another floor level in same apartment,9.6
Nice location very clean and well equiped. ,9.6
Located in the European district very easy to reach by train from the airport in a lively neighbourhood.The apartment was super clean and comfortable with all necessary appliances. Will definitely come back! ,10
Excellent as usually. But what especially liked was the perfectly clean water kettle - free of any lime deposits. I also appreciate the additional heater in the bathroom to keep it warm enough in the winter months.. Without problems.,10
Great location. Spacious with kitchen bathroom toilet. Separate living area and bedroom. Comfy bed.  ,9.6
It is modern clean and in a very accessible location. Coffee machine. Bicycle. Fast WiFi.  No elevator,10
Lovely landlord Yomi looked after my daughter ,10
Nice apartment close to the EC area. This mean is perfect if you are in Brussels for meeting purposes. The appartment was clean. ,10
The location is great. Only a walking distance from restaurants and EU Institutions. The host is very informative. The room was very clean warm and cosy. ,8
Everything was great as usual!Owner very helpful.  ,9
Excellent location good bed spotless clean ,9
Location is perfect if need to close to the main European Commission building. ,9.2
Almost everything except that the price raised rather steeply by the time I booked the place compared to a few days before. Almost nothing. I just wished I could extend the stay longer so that I didnt have to move to another place which happened to be quite crappy to spend the some of my vacation nights in Belgium.,9
Very good location! Large apartment with a lot of space.  Just a minor detail: I would have liked a little better lights by the mirror in the bathroom.,9.2
comfy small duplex just behind the Berlaymont (EU Commission). Smart do-it-yourself check-in so you can arrive whenever you like. Coffee and tea included. the service is excellent. If I have to say something probably some biscuits for breakfast might make the staying even more pleasant.,10
Apartment was cleand every 3 days. Nothing to complain about.,10
The property was clean and easily accessible by public transport but the host was not flexible nor helpful. ,8
The best accommodation I have ever had in Brussels. It cannot be better..,10
Location is excellent the apartment is spacious. I liked having an exercise bike in the living room at my disposal. ,9
The location was perfect right near the EC buildings and Schuman station. The flat is spacious and has a fully equipped kitchen. Also an exercise bike! I wish I could have stayed longer. Be aware that you have to carry your bags up three flights of narrow and fairly steep stairs. You need good eyesight to set the codes on the keybox.,8
The property was spacious and a lovely place to be right in the centre of Bruge. I would have liked some information about the apartment for example how to work the heating and the WiFi password etc. And some recommendations for restaurants and places to visit would have been a nice extra. ,10
Location security and cleanliness Shower door into kitchen and maybe a couple of extra hooks or a shelf in the bathroom,10
The bed is amazing! The courtyard is a nice addition and the bikes are a must around town. The place is clean and comfortable and the location couldnt be better ,9.6
The location amazing decor freedom of it being self catering lovely staff in the hotel. The bedbugs! Came home covered in bites.,8.8
The apartment was very charming with double high ceilings and a quaint medieval style that was in keeping with Bruges ,10
Quirky charming accommodation slap bang in the middle of Brugge. Theres a pleasant large shared terrace and an upstairs loft for sleeping. ,8.8
Location location location. Quirky decoration comfortable bed. Privacy is an issue as 2x double beds in one room. A curtain would solve this. Got bitten by mozzies.,9.2
great location close to the centre. Electronic entry was very easy to arrange. LIft broke down wouldnt use it.,8
No keys all door codes Larger Microwave bowls for cooking spoons for stirring  food other than cutlery. Microwave more accessible as it was placed under the work top. Tall people would struggle here as head height was quite restrictive.,8
The location of the apartment was perfect. We had a lot of rain so it was nice to be able to pop back from town to warm up. We loved the lighting and the quirkiness.even the stairs to the bedroom which demand a bit of concentration :-) ,8
The location was just perfect and the use of the bicycles free of charge was great! My husband is tall - the loft apartment was too low for him. I think the height should be specified on the website.,7.9
I loved the layout of the room. It was so central. So clean and tidy. ,10
The apartment was spacious and well-decorated with a nice large bed. We wish we could have stayed longer than one night! Its very close to everything as well. It was easy to find and simple to check in.  We will definitely stay here again. The wi-fi is quite poor so you might need to use your own data at times. It can also get a bit noisy at night (people walking home from the bars). The check-out time is quite early compared to other places but the apartment is VERY cute and convenient so its still worth the stay.,10
Cozy apartment very well appointed in a perfect location (next to the Vismarkt. Bicycles provided too! Few stairs to the apartment. Bed upstairs in loft with relatively low ceiling fine for us. Bathroom small (shower inclusive) but nice and worked great for us (and rain showerhead). Essentials provided (including for cooking if you want to do that). Super easy check in/out which also helped for our late-ish arrival time. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Minor note that the Senseo coffee maker with provided pods makes fair American-style coffee but its awful by European standards. No problem but Nespresso-style is much preferred at least for us.,10
I thought the location was great and easy to check in and very happy to be able to leave my bags before checkin.  Room was clean and comfortable and well equipped.  The bed... thank you for provided such a nice bed. Just please be careful when going upstairs to where the beds are.  So very easy to bang your head on the beams.,10
Location and hospitality excellent. Clean and tidy and perfect heating on the winter nights!! It was all perfect . No complaints,10
The location is perfect with the fish market yards away and underground public parking at the end of the road. Received codes for doors in email easy to access. The apartment was clean and well equipped for a short stay The descriptions and photos could be clearer so you know what you are getting. The two double beds are both in the same upstairs space and may not be suitable for two couples as no privacy. Worked ok for us as 3 friends though.,7.9
Accommodation was excellent close to amenities and parking Now that the evenings are drawing in the owners might want to consider installing a light above the push-pad on the outer entrance door,10
Fab location and such a warm and cosy apartment for a family of four. After spending all day walking around Bruges it was lovely to come back to the apartment which was stylishly furnished and lovely and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped for making a meal. It had a cooker microwave and a fridge. There was a problem with the shower. I think air in the pipes meant that it wasnt as powerful as it should have been. However the shower room itself was lovely and soap shower gel and shampoo provided.,10
Location convenient and free bikes a nice perk Low ceilings and showerhead. Lack of adequate towels for out stay provided. Had to duck to climb stairs (I am 56). Bitten badly during our stay by what I thought was mosquitoes later diagnosed by a doctor as bed bugs. Woken up by workmen as early as seven am on two occasions.  Workmens tools and broken furniture left in front of our door.,4.6
The apartment was very well positioned right in the center and the place was very cute appreciated the outdoor terrace.  It would have been great to have a couple of blankets and two more pillows. The terrace could use some maintenance. The TV was quite old it would be nice if the apartment had Netflix or a way to connect to your own device at least. ,9
The apartment has a wonderful balcony and a large living room. Great for business travelers or a couple on holiday. Close to the city center with plenty of cafes and shops within 5 minutes walking. ,10
Spotless comfortable perfect location and very friendly hosts. I highly recommend this place.  ,10
The apartment is true to the pictures. Very conveniently located. ,10
Everything were perfect  There was everything we were looking for at home. I would definitely recommend ,10
Everything from check in to check out and all of the bits in between. It was beautiful weather so made use of the terrace.  Nothing,10
Fantastic location and stylish interior matched by high level of comfort.  Nothing negative,10
Great appartment in the city center. Well renovated beautifull terrace with the sun at the end of the day. Even Dutch TV with all the biggest movie channels.Lovend it!! N/a,9
The decorations The lighting in the living room it is rather dark. ,8.8
Furnished to a very high standard and everything is spotless.  WiFi television kitchen etc. all very easy to work.  The layout is a bit unique however that is part of the charm. The tub in the front room did not seem to have hot water.,10
Very easy instructions to get into the apartment. ,9.6
Spacious rooms that were well furnished. Everything was very clean and peaceful location outside the main city but with good transport availability. No sink with the toilet and shower/bath was difficult to use. There were also no curtains or netting in the bathroom. This is fine but it should have been clearer when booking. Although there is parking it is only for 2 hours before you have to change the parking permit so not very practical if away. Although we did feel secure there was possible access into the locked rooms via lift. ,8.3
This apartment is located in an amazing area. Parking space was never an issue. Grocery pharmacy cafes restaurants public transportation - all available around the corner! ,10
Very stylish place nice peaceful location  ,9.6
everything was superlative .. clean space modern kitchen coffee and tea on the house :)) no complein,9.6
It was perfect even exceeded our expectation Quite in the middle of nowhere:) but it is not so bad if you have a car and you can be easily in the middle of Brussels Mechelen or Antwerp within 15 to 45 minutes.,9.6
very calm place perfect place to sleep well with family.  ,9.6
Location food for breakfast. Everything was ok.,10
The appartment is big. The location is very good for tourisits who has a car. Some furniture is old.,8.8
Excellent service and the details for arrive is good ,10
Very quick and easy communication with the host amazingly friendly and easy-going just perfect hosts no negative points just 110% positivity !!! ,10
Very confortable apartment.  They surprised us each day with an excellent breakfast anda also typical belgian beer in frigo.  Thank you so much for all..we will come back ,10
The room was big.  Nice shower. The airconditioning was too strong. The bedsheets were thin.,7.1
Good breakfast staff very nice outside good looking dedicated parking lot secured via dedicated code. Even if a bit far away from Mons this hotel gives you an easy access to the Mons city which is very saturated in term of traffic. This is a very good point. bathroom .. took about 5 minutes before to get hot water in the shower.. if we can call this hot.  oh and be careful with the bed.. you can hurt yourself by bumping your legs into the bed structure which sticks out of the mattress. I have a big bruise on my tibia today -_-,6
The hotel staff Air conditioner varely working. Noisy Place. Could not sleep very well. Many details in the room. The lady in the reception outstandings. She makes de difference.,5
The room was set out nicely with a comfy bed the location was in an easy to get to area and breakfast was buffet with plenty of options. Staff stayed chatting while I was try to pay for breakfast and leave,9.6
The Receptionist was friendly and helpful and spoke English. Room was small but very modern cozy and clean. Breakfast fad a great variety of items to choose from and good coffee. Private parking was much appreciated. We would stay again and gladly recommend this hotel. ,9.6
Nice very quite location clean and tidy room friendly people running the hotel. A restaurant downstairs serves delicious food the service is very nice and friendly. There was a problem with the hairdryer - it didnt work and it wasnt fixed during my stay.,9.6
Pleasantly surprised as the surrounding area is very working class and drab. The bed and pillows,7.1
good hi-tech hotel with a private parking. We didnt have a chance to go to the restaurant at the hotel but as far as we could see it looks really nice. ,9.6
We found this hotel to be brilliant and staff excellent we had an apartment lovely and clean and good space we eat at the restaurant the food and service were excellent in every aspect I made a new best friend the cat out side. Thank-you  Nothing,10
Good Italian restaurant in the hotel.  Good level parking. La Louviere not a pretty place.  Entry to car park very narrow through building.,9.2
Helpful and responsive staff. Room was quite a big apartment. Nice private parking despite being inbthe middle of the city. Breakfast was a bit limited not included in the not very cheap price of the room. Water took very long to heat up in the shower maybe because room was on the top floor but this was rather wasteful.,7.5
Excellent breakfast! Nice and confy rooms! ,10
Normal size room clean quiet (as on the back of the property). Eager to help receptionist she explained calmly all the issues. The access to the room and main entrance is done with a code should keep it with you if not memorize it. The entrance to the parking is extremely narrow I had some problems to avoid scratching the car. Personally I needed some guidance to go straight. So not suitable for big cars.,6
Nice food and excellent wine selection in the restaurant! ,9.2
Beautifully decorated room in a modern setting. Perfectly clean room & bathroom no speck of dust to be found. Separate entry for the guest section giving you the opportunity as a guest to have your privacy. Friendly host that was welcoming & pool is available to be used for the guests. We really enjoyed the breakfast it came with homemade yoghurts & jams fruits croissants & fresh bread - so definitely enough to start your day & very tasty! The location is a bit outside of the city centre easy to be reached by car but by bike you need to climb a hill in order to reach the place.,10
very good breakfast french style home made products very pleasant hosts adorable pets opportunity to enjoy a very good live performance of classical music (Mozart Chopin..) impeccable cleanliness super location that offers you splendid walk through nature extremely comfortable suite. ,10
I fully recommend Ardenne B&B. It is very well located in a nice and quiet area ideal for visiting the surroundings. The rooms are spacious clean and well equipped. The owners are  friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was delicious. ,10
Hosts are nice and kind and their dog is adorable. We felt welcomed. Its a good place to rest for a few days and enjoy nature around.  It is a bit difficult to find specially in the dark. There is no sign at the entry.,8
Superb breakfast stunning view from the room host very polite and nice! ,9
I booked this B&B simply because its location (near to La-Roche-en-Ardennes Chouffe etc) but it really surprised me: a modern house in the middle of the forest everything is modern and clean.  The highlight: an excellent breakfast.  I recommend this place for a relaxing weekend in the Ardennes BTW we also bought honey produced at the same place.. super lekker! There is not any visible advertisement with the name of the B&B. It took us 5-10 min before finding the right place.,10
Super nice and kind hosts calm surroundings and fresh air peaceful and cosy room had a great sleep super tasty local food for breakfast very nice stay ,10
It was very clean and all the necessary appliances were available. There was not even a small vacuum or a manual brush to clean up the floor only a little one. With 2 children under 4 it would be useful. I would suggest even that a cheap automatic robot would do it would be a great addition. ,10
The apartment was exactly as shown on the pictures and very well furnished. Everything was great,9
Great location with a view on the castle and church at the starting point of all regional hikes near all shops.Spacious modern apartment. Eyes for details like complimentary chocolates and Chouffe beer in the fridge cosy blankets and even a Christmas tree  ,10
Extremely quiet. Supermarket right around the corner. The doorhandle has to be turned upwards otherwise the door wont open.,8
Excellent quality of interior finishing and all the amenities: all available like tea and coffee washing up liquid la chouffe beers oil to cook shampoo even chocolates for the kids.To our surprise there was also a netflix account to be used!!Location is spot on right in the city centre within a minute you can get food from the supermarket fresh bread from the bakery pick up pizzas or visit the tourist information.Plenty of parking to (un) load a short walk from free parking.Dishwasher and dishwasher tablets available all clean and made beds. Excellent.Family of four and had plenty of space. Nothing the apartment can help but in summertime in the centre every night there is quite loud music and talk explaining the history of the village. It lasts about twenty minutes.,10
Well organised good info before arrival! ,9
The apartment with castle view is excellent. It is spacious and cosy has all the equipment necessary. The kitchen is great to prepare meals while the restaurants are closed. The location is very convenient right in the centre and close to parkings. Easy and efficient communication. The terrace has a great view. I will gladly come back! ,10
Great professional staff. Typical budget hotel. I enjoyed my stay. Wonderful location. ,8.8
The location was great close to the train station and close to the sights. Very helpful staff. ,10
Location is good. Close to Grand Place. 5 minutes walk from the station. ,10
Location location location Nothing to complain5 for the price.  The staff at breakfast area were very nice,9.2
The location is good. Very close to train station and easy to go everywhere in Brussels. The room is comfortable and the staffs are nice. There is nothing much that I dont like. The hotel is a little bit expensive compared with same level in other countries but its normal price in Brussels,9.2
The simpathy of the workers the cleaning and the localization The view from the apartment,7.5
Location was excellent staff very friendly. ,10
The location was great. Few minutes away from Central Station and Grande Place. The bed and bathroom was very clean. It was quiet and comfortable. There was no coffee machine kettle and fridge in the room.,8.8
Great Central location. Very basic with plastic undesheet. Tripping over Roma Beggars around the streets,6.3
the location is fantastic near from mannekin pis near from grand palace near from restaurant and shop. just 3 minute walk to grand palace all what you need is in the round of the hotel the view also very good. superb. ,9
Really good breakfast and location is perfect! Center of Brussels town center. ,7.9
The location was the best about this hotel and the room size was good and the staff was helpful. Also the cafe downstairs and the bakery was very nice and good quality for the value of the money. the sound coming from the toilet and the water running across the pipes in the walls was non-stop all day and night.,8
The location really is perfect and central to everything. The staff is very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the conversations we had tremendously. Pointers to lovely restaurants and things to enjoy. ,10
The hotel was perfect. Centrally located (less than 5 minutes from the train station) rooms were beautifully decorated. Great sized room and bathroom. Beds were very comfortable. The staff were so helpful and polite. Hairdryer in the rooms which was a great help as I forgot mine!! Absolutely nothing!! Everything was marvelous,10
The location was perfect and the bed was very comfortable. In addition the TV had enish stations. The bathroom tub wall was very high.,9.6
Great location rich breakfast staff very professional helpful  and smile a lot. ,10
excellent breakfast and location on the 5th floor in the bathroom to have a shower you need to stay a little bent.,7.1
In the very heart of Brussels fair value for price and nice staff. Its just behind the Grand Place but it is not so noisy. In some conditions not being able to reach the hotel (pedestrian zone) with public transports is a bit limiting.,8.3
Bed was very confortable.Location was amazing! The hotel was very basic. No frills at all which would have been nice to know before we arrived.The shower was awful so was the toilet.Breakfast was not good.,7.1
I liked the location and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I thought the breakfast could have been better with more options. Our room was also very warm even with the air conditioning on.,7.9
Excellent location close to Gare Central right in pedestrian area. Price high for accommodation. Average breakfast,7.9
The place is great! The bed is comfortable! Difficult to get proper temperature of water in shower room CA very noisy I felt like ia airplane  all night long second night I turned off but it get cold in my room.!,8
Great location great value A little dusty and dirty around the edges,9.2
Breakfast was adequate and delicious but for stays of more than one day it might become a bit limited.  Location was fabulous: Grand Palace right around the corner the Museum of Fine Arts within easy walking distance as are a few supermarkets and many chocolate shops. Staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. They smoothly and safely kept our luggage for several hours after we checked out. There were not enough open plugs in easy to access places in the room. Soap is the only complimentary toiletry. Lugging (pulling rolling carrying etc.) our suitcases up the steady slope to the Brussels Central train station through milling crowds of tourists etc. was not easy. Not a fault of the hotel but of the square cobblestones in the area.,9.2
Excellent location in historic area near Le Grande Place vibrant neighbourhood lots of cafes and bars nearby clean modern decor and rooms helpful staff big comfortable bed.. ,9.6
Location was ideal right in the city centre couldnt ask for a better location!  No tea or coffee kettle in the room breakfast was charged unfairly and the shower was loose and couldnt stay still.,6.7
This is my favourite place to stay in Brussels from now on! Its location is absolutely great (just behind the Grand Place) it has really comfortable and nice rooms (I guess it was refurbished pretty recently) breakfast is good and varied and staff is very kind. Compared to many places to stay in Brussels in this price range and with the same number of stars I would definitely choose it. I actually enjoyed everything maybe one small sugestion is to introduce some juices or water for breakfast they only have coffee and tea (or maybe I didnt see it).,10
Location Location and Location - Its fantastic. 2 min walk from the Grand Place. Mostly all attractions can be covered by foot. All within a radius of 10 mins. I was in room 505. Its called the kings room with a nice view. The staffs were extremely courteous!I will definitely book again. Recommend! If I have to tell the cons there is hardly any. I feel at this category a bit bigger room would have been nice and may be we were lame to not figure out but the water from the bathtub doesnt go out. Had to tell the reception but they took care of it. ,9
Nice selection of food - tasted great and presented well. Only issue we had was with the shower. Water was either very very very hot or cold - very difficult to find the right balance but in the end we got clean and enjoyed our stay at the hotel.,9
 For a 3* hotel it was exactly how it should be. Nothing to dislike. We will stay here again when in Brussels.,10
Location The family room didnt have a refrigerator,8.3
Location is best. The staff is amazing. Hotel comes with buffet breakfast but everyday its the same. Maybe they can alternate the protein everyday.,10
fantastic location friendly multilingual staff and parking nearby. The hotel has been refurbished and it is a nice improvement. There is no bar but there are vending machines.. and why have a bar in the center of bruxelles! ,8.8
Location. Far overpriced hotel in top location.,5.8
The hotel was in an amazing location you could see the tops of the buildings of the Grand Place. The hairdryer provided in the room was non-functional.,9.6
Aris hotel is the top in Bruxelles. It is in one of the main street of the downtown close to the central station. Very clean and comfortable.  Staff is very very kind. Close to one of the  few vegan and glutenfree restaurant in Bruxelles. ,9
The hotel is very basic and functional the room was ok breakfast was adequate there was nothing unpleasant about it but nothing particularly nice or worthy of recommendation. A dependable budget option in a very central location. No tea making facilities,6.3
Breakfast was good and the bed was quite comfortable. Also its located literally in the center of brussels. The room i was given (room 112 or 113 i guess) was an aftermade room it was so small cold air conditioning wasnt effective at all window was an old type and i got cold during night. Price for that room was unacceptable.,7.1
my stay was only a single night before flying home to Australia. the location was really great basically in the historic heart of the city and close to the central station making getting to the airport a breeze. It was easy to spend a couple of hours in the morning exploring the city before taking train to airport. the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable and clean. ,8
Location is perfect No fridge in the room very poor breakfast buffet and breakfast served in the lobby which is not nicely furnished. Doors of The wardrops are aboƒ±tvto come off.,6.3
Location is in the heart of the city and view from the window is fantastic! 2 minutes walk from the main train station. Room is well designed and clean. ,10
Fabulous location and fabulous breakfast Be careful in the shower.the water temperature can change suddenly,10
The hotel is situated in the very city center literally everything is super close. The front desk staff we didnt get the names but a blond woman and a man with glasses during the night were really the best! They answered to all of our questions (so helpful) are were really the best ones! Thank you guys to you and the whole hotel staff for making our weekend so enjoyable ‚ù§Ô∏è ,9.6
Great location. Dirty towels noisy street,7.1
Location was perfect The central location was what made the short break so much better.,10
Staff very professional. A bit old but still good.,8.3
Great staff! Very thankful for early check in it was raining and my room was ready. Thank you so much!  ,8
Brilliant location staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about local areas. Thank you very much guys - we had a wonderful time. Absolutely recommend them ,8.8
Great location clean and comfortable room friendly staff Pre-authorisation on my credit card - which is reasonable however should comminicate before.,9.2
Wonderful location convenient for the central station sightseeing and shopping. The entrance foyer is rather off putting and does not do justice to the rest of the hotel,8
Location was excellent. Room on Ground Floor facing the street Poor wi-fi no plugs anywhere near the bed no hairdryer showers curtain not working,6.7
Sam at reception was excellent recommending the best coffee in town and the best Brasserie for dinner No hooks in the bathroom and no tea/coffee facilities in the room,9.5
The best is the staff working there super friendly and helpful. Location is excellent. Airco also good. Quite comfortable hotel. Breakfast is a bit poor. It has just the basics. Tomate taste was not good.,8.8
The staff are friendlyThe location is very good it is located in the center near the Grand Place No essential room facilities: No toilet spicemens No slipper No refrigerator No kettle- Very Poor breakfast: Cost is high in comparison with room size and other nearby hotels,7.9
Location location location! Its very central just few steps from the Grand Palace. Great restaurants are everywhere. Despite the fact that it is right in the middle of everything your sleep would not be disturbed by any noise. Bed is comfortable and breakfast is good. I knew that check in is not until 3pm. Staff were great to allow me to leave my luggage as I arrived earlier than check-in time. I went around and came back at 3pm but was made t0 wait close to about 30 minutes before my room was ready. Had to follow-up about 3 times before I was actually given my room. It is frustrating especially if there is a huge time difference from where you are from and you really need to lie down for a bit of rest.,9.6
The location was great just near central station. Convenient access to transport. The Grand Place was not even a two minute walk away. Very easy and comfortable to walk around this part of town.Staff were very helpful in terms of printing off documentation etc.The tvs could be programmed to show the English speaking channels. No complaints.,9.6
Perfect location couldnt be better! Nice breakfast nice staff clear facilities. Would highly recommend. ,8.3
The room with the attic is very big.  The beds are comfortable. The location is great. Its near the central station and pedestrian zone.  A lot of shops are around. Its the walking distance to almost every landscapes. There is no fridge no tea cups no water boiler in the room.,9.6
Perfect location and lovely hotel! Nothing I loved it,10
The room was pretty big and comfortable. The location was the best part: easy walk from all the touristic places the Brussels Central Station good restaurants and also breweries that you must visit. Very helpful and friendly staff. No big things to add. But the window of the room on the ground floor faced directly to the street on the side of the hotel ended up staying with the curtains closed to have more privacy. Good breakfast but could have more options for vegans.,9.6
Great location Its on the pedestrian area so you have to walk from taxi to the hotel. A kettle on the room would be great so we dont have to go back and forth to the breakfast area to get some hot water,5.4
the position is nice the room could be cleaner,6.3
Location is great near the station and just a step from grand place. Rooms are comfortable.Complimentary coffee and tea.  The bath worked  ok but  the shower didnt have any pressure so hardly any water came out in shower head.,8.8
It was a last minute decision which we did not regret. The price/quality was excellent. Check-in quick and staff extremely friendly. Given the choice of a central hotel in Brussels I would book again and would recommend to anyone. ,10
Location is very good staff very kindly and helpful ,10
Location in city relatevly quiet rooms. Could have better breakfast awful coffee.,6.7
Clean hotel friendly staff in the center of the city Noise at the weekends taxi could not reach the hotel and you need to carry your own bags for 4m walk to reach the hotel,7.9
The staff are very friendly super comfortable and clean room breakfast with a good variety of food and location is amazing just behind of the Grand Place. Lovely hotel in general. Price is fair if you think about the location and the quality of the service. Id certainly come back next time Ill be in Bruxelles. Nothing it was everything good.,10
I liked the location so much. It was in the MIDDLE of everything. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Everything was perfect,10
Staff were so friendly and very helpful excellent location to everythingwe stayed in the family room which was very spacious and really clean would definitely stay here again.  There was nothing I didnt like.,9
Great location (easy to find). Effecient friendly staff and reasonable price Nothing comes to mind,9.6
A good breakfest nice place clean room. ,9.2
 The hotel was very hard to find. Please include the street address and a readable map on the website.,8
It was really comfortable  My first room had a dirty bathroom,7
Location just next to Grand Place and central railway station. Nice and clean rooms. Good value for money. Nothing to complain about. A 3 star hotell with the facilities and standard you expect.,7.5
Location is superb! Rooms are a little outdated.,9.6
Very central location and nice staff. Soap and shampoo from Rituals. It so central but the sound isolation is not good enough. There is noisy all the day. We stayed in a king room and there was no quiter room. Poor breakfast. Very old building should be renovated asap! The bathroom was very old broken walls and bathtube. The bed quite comfortable but not the pillows. It is a ok choice but very expensive for whatvyou get.,6.3
The water pressure was amazing the bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the windows were sound proof. It was set right in the middle of everything. The staff went out of there way to accommodate me. I will be back,9.6
The hotel is well situated. The water in the shower did not drain away.,6.3
The location the staff and the breakfast was good. The phone was not working.,10
The location of this hotel is he best for trains and local sightseeing. Bonus - local tour shop next door. Fantastic restaurants on door step. Would definitely recommend a stay here. The only downfall if there is one is that a taxi cannot stop at the front door.,7.1
Location was great. Size of the rrom was also nice. There was no fridge in the room. Bathroom only upstairs.,7.1
Location was greatStaff all lovely Rooms and beds comfyClean with good service Noise outside was minimal Stylish lounge Good breakfast Would definitely recommend  Nothing really. Its a no frills but perfectly lovely little hotelI guess tea facilities would be nice but I wouldnt expect that in a 3 star hotel necessarily,9.2
The location is the best.  The staffs were excellent. And the breakfast was just just mind-blowing. ,10
A beautiful view polite staff and a great breakfast. Very easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go in the center of it all very near Grand Place. My friends room was very nice and cool but ours was hot and the AC did not work we opened the windows which made it plenty cool enough but the street was so loud at night that it kept us up. That is the only compliant the rest was really amazing. We loved the room so much we did not report it for fear they would move us and we would lose our perfect view. So we are to blame on  that.,9.2
very friendly helpful staff rather noisy at night- but perhaps unavoidable in a city centre location,8
It is very very conveniently situated near central rail station. Wardrobe needed replacing.Toilet had a small but constant leak.,7.9
The room is spacious and nicely done up. The hotel is well located as it is near the train station and close to attractions. Nothing I can think of.,8.8
Central and very good communication with staff. Some remarks about the cleanness in the bathroom and on the desk.,7
Perfect Location just behind the grand place room was very good ,9.6
Location was excellent There is no charging sockets near bed .i have to put charger down floor where they use vacumm cleaner for cleaning.,7.9
Great location in the heart of Brussels. Walking distance to all major attractions and restaurants ,9
Perfect location friendly stuff nice breakfast comfortable beds Could be better ventilation in the bathroom.,8.8
The location was really in the center but no noise at night the bed was very comfortable. ,8.8
 We had an incident with one of the receptionists. He was a tall white guy. Even though his shift had ended and he was leaving he made it his business to harass us while we were trying to get some hot water and a spoon for the tea that we brought outselves. Instead of trying to help he made us feel most unwelcome he treated us like we were about to rob the place. His remarks and attitude were very condescending. Thankfully the other receptionist was present while this happened and apologized on his behalf. He helped us get what we need. The other staff was great too.,7.9
Excellent location sparkling clean surprisingly quiet. The breakfast is not large but of good quality. After an overseas flight I would have liked to have an early check-in but it was not possible.,9.6
The location was perfect only about a 2 minute walk to the grand place the centre of Brussels and 5 minutes to central train station. The breakfast was good as well. ,7.9
Location is perfect only a short walk from Centraal train station. Internet speed was good and the staff was friendly.  Actually the location is also good when you like to walk 35 minutes to the Commission buildings - they are only 24 km away (you can also use public transportation then it takes about 20 minutes). The only issue was a street noise on the street as the room was at street level and therefore it was impossible to use the room without curtains because without curtains you could see people walking by your bed.,7
Clean nice size tub with hot water close to restaurants comfortable beds lovely front desk personnel. Noise.we couldnt sleep.there was yelling and partying outside most of the night. The breakfast was mediocre.cold boiled eggs old soft apples glueten free buns were frozen in the middle. Taxis couldnt get to the hotel so it was difficult walking up hills on cobblestones. Fortunately we were able to pay a hotel guest to walk with us to the train station and carry our luggage on wheels for us..fortunately it wasnt raining.,7.9
Amazing location right in the centre! Easy walk to everything  ,8.8
Excellent location. Very clean place.  I definitely reccomend it. ,10
Great location very close to all the major attractions Very cleanGood price for the services provided  The pillow was not very comfortable,7.9
Very very well placed! We visited almost everything by walk.Very clean and nice shower products! The water temperature from the shower was really hard to control.If you are a light sleeper it could be hard because you can hear whats happening outside (luckily I am not so it really didnt bother me at all).,9
It is in a great location for the centre of Brussels. Staff were friendly and the room very clean and comfortable On Saturday  I came to the Breakfast area quite late on and I could not find a clean table for breakfast also some of the food was no longer available. I did complain about this and in fairness they deducted the cost of my breakfast from my room rate. This Monday morning all was good tables all cleared and plenty of food available,8.8
Location was great near the Grand Place and Central Station the room was fine and a good choice for breakfast (cooked continental fruit). Staff friendly. Nothing,9.6
Amazing location just one street behind Grand Place. Clean rooms sturdy beds and a nice powerful shower. Staff were friendly. Came back to the room one afternoon to find that the maid had left our door lying wide open. No sign of them in the corridors so they had clearly made the room up then forgot to close the door. Thankfully all valuables were in the safe.,8.8
Very good position that increase the quality/price. Polite and helpfull stuff For my point of view the rooms and the service could be improved considered the high requested rate.,7.5
So close to the Grand Place Quite noisy,10
Its location and breakfast. First we have booked to be staying in this hotel and later we were warned that we were staying in ALMA hotel. The location is very good similar to the one booked. However the room was not that good. We have paid for a large room with (king premuum whatever that means) and the room arquitecture didnt make any sense. During the evening the curtains couldnt close all the light and there was a lot of noise. Besides we could have stayed in Hilton or NH for less or the same price. First time this happens when booking with Booking I must say.,5.4
Very clean and extremely friendly staff. There appeared to be a water draining noise right next to my room.,8.3
Well located property great breakfast comfortable bed ,10
good locationÔºåjust in the center of the attractions. but little bit walk from the tain station if you have luggage.nice helpful staff at reception. very small roomÔºåcant even fit the luggageÔºåbut big washroom.no heater in the room.,8.3
Nice hotel with amazing staff the location is perfect Everything was good,10
Nice hotel right in the center little bit expensivebut location is worth it ,7.9
Breakfasts were good Too expensive for the level of quality,6.3
New reception is great and now there is a kettle with tea and coffee in the room.Bring an adapter that has the old European two pin plugs (thinner than the ones you get in Eurostar and most airports). Wonderful hotel always stay here if possible when coming to Brussels to try to stop Brexit.,10
the breakfast wqs good locatin very good would have been good to have had tea making in the room good that we took our own travel kettle & cups,7.9
Breakfast was good. Parking cost $18.00 for the night. Grout was falling out in places in the bathroom. Was also difficult to control the temperature of the water in the shower. Hot was nearly boiling! The bed was missing a foot on one corner and was very hard,6.7
The location of Aris Grand Place Hotel is prefect right in the right of the city. Easy to get to by public transport and lots of restaurants around. Room was a good size and we were facing the ally and we couldnt hear anything. Breakfast was good. Didnt love our bathroom it was big but the shower/bath needed to be clean better and the shower curtain I didnt like. Pillows were also not comfortable.,7.9
Everything all the little attentions provided by our hosts. Breakfast was perfect room was a peaceful haven after a day of sight seeing. We loved our stay. The street is very busy but we still had great night sleep despite of the noise which eventually dies down at night.,10
Mario was a wonderful host. He gave us lots of tips for eating places practical information about tourist sites and gave us a delicious breakfast.  Our room was spotlessly clean and very quiet and comfortable.  We would definitely stay there again. Thank you Mario. Absolutely nothing!,10
Mario and Ivan were the most welcoming hosts! Location was perfect they were very helpful at pointing out places of interest and restuarants. Our room was large and very comfortable with a great coffee machine and drinks selection which was refreshed daily! Breakfast was simple but refreshing the additional sample of fresh juice every morning was delicious. The boutique b&b has been lovingly  restored  it felt like our home from home we loved it. ,10
This accommodation was so far the best of all previous trips! ,10
Mario our host was delightful. The accommodation and hospitality were top notch. Breakfast was lovely. Would absolutely stay again. There was nothing to not like.,10
I am a little slow with this review as we stayed at Art de Sejour mid August.  I would highly recommend this bed and breakfast.  Very central to shops and tourist attractions in old part of Brussels.  Absolutely amazing! Mario was brillant from helpful welcome and tips where to eat drink and best way to get to airport. Room so modern clean and beautiful toiletries also very spacious.  Despite being on busier road very quiet. Nothing it was fantastic!  It does not surprise me that this accommodation has excellent reviews.,10
Details both big and small make Art du Sejour a delightful gem: heavenly coffee and amenities delicious breakfasts luxurious bedding and quietcool atmosphere. Mario has created a perfect B&B experience. Cant think of one negative.,10
Everything was great The only thing to slightly let it down was the selection of breads at breakfast as they were rather hard we would have liked some softer rolls or a toast option but this would not stop us returning.,9
Mario was an incredibly thoughtful hospitable and welcoming host. He takes incredibly good care to make sure that you are comfortable and has your needs met while also going above and beyond making sure that hygiene and health standards are kept during these Covid-19 times for the health and safety of everyone staying there. The rooms were spotlessly clean incredibly comfortable and the location is perfect - short walking distance to the city centre and many other points of interest while also quiet enough for a good nights sleep.  Public parking is also conveniently located across the street which was great for us since we travelled by car. If youre looking for a clean comfortable hospitable stay while in Brussels I couldnt recommend Art de Sejour enough ,10
Mario aims to spoil his guests and certainly succeeds! Our room was gorgeous extremely clean and so so comfortable.  Wonderful bathroom.  Bed/pillows/linens were very comfortable and high quality.  Fabulous breakfast is personally made for each guest. Great location/minutes to Grande Place. Train station at the corner.  One word sums it up...PERFECTION! ,10
Awesome place and owner was very accommodating due to arriving a little later and leaving super early. The room was spectacular and we appreciated the owner sitting down with us to give highlights of the city. The to-go breakfast was a really nice touch due to us having to arrive at airport by 7:30 AM. Overall really amazing property.,10
Everything was great. We loved our one night and wished we had been able to stay a bit longer. (AND..Mario gave us some fixtures and kitchen appliances input on our upcoming remodel). Thank you! ,10
A beautiful property well situated for walking around the city. Beautiful decor with an artistic blend of old and new. The facilities were of a high standard and could not fault a thing. Our room was large and even had a dressing area tea and coffee maker fridge with complimentary drinks. Bathroom was modern with a walk in shower and toiletries and the towels and dressing gowns smelt divine!! Mario was a wonderful host and spent time explaining where to visit in and around the city and the places to avoid! We are so pleased we chose to stay there!!  The area outside is undergoing renovations but out of host control. Long term only a good thing for his business.,9.6
The property was perfectly located with all of Brussels main tourist sights no more than a 15 minute walk away. The room was spacious and the shower was amazing with a large and comfortable double bed. Mario is a simply amazing host offering you a range of breakfasts each morning an all inclusive mini bar in the room and giving you a map talking you through the must see sights and where tourist traps are located! Two nights just wasnt enough we shall be returning soon ! ,10
We felt excellent! The bed was comfortable the room is sparkling clean the host was very welcoming. I strongly recommend this place! ,10
The room was beautiful with a really big comfortable bed.  The bathroom was spotless and had a really good selection of LOccitan toiletries.  There was free sodas and water as well as tea and coffee plus chocolates and biscuits.  There was also plenty of space to store clothes and suitcases. The breakfast was excellent with fresh juice and really nice bread. Alvin welcomed us and was very helpful.  He gave us a map and suggested places to eat and drink.  We went to one of those places and it was great. We would stay here again next time were in Brussels. I cant think of anything negative about this hotel.,10
Mario was the perfect host.  Our jobs are extremely stressful and we just totally relaxed in this special place .  The room was luxurious  we were greeted every morning with an amazing breakfast where Mario even got to know our preferences. Everything about the surroundings  made you realise how much thought were put into the details- just check out that beautiful red door.  Breakfast started with a surprise smoothie every day! We were centrally located - to your  left - just a hop skip and a jump and your at the centre of the city and to your right just a few steps to the subway.  What a perfect way to start our trip in Belgium. ITS THE ONLY PLACE TO BE IN BRUSSELS. We travel a lot and really we couldnt find anything.. it was just amazing,10
Wonderful host great location & breakfast! The rooms were clean and beautifully decorated with lovely Loccitane products in the bathroom & Nespresso machine/complimentary soft drinks. Would definitely come back!  Couldnt say anything I didnt like!,10
Wonderful Fabulous attention to every detail and host friendly helpful and made a healthy breakfast as well. accommodations exceeded expectation w nice linens computer espresso machine in room & grand shower.  Felt Very luxurious calm comfortable space to just be. Within walking distance of all the sites. ,10
Everything was perfect. The renovation was modern stylish and elegant. The bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast were delicious!  Nothing we didnt like,10
The hosts very helpful and recommended sights and restaurants. Breakfast lovely. Room outstanding only hotel I have visited where all boxes have been ticked. Attention to detail was amazing shame we only stayed one night. Nothing couldnt find any fault.,10
We stayed at Art de Sejour hotel for two nights March 23rd and 24th 2019. The hotel is about 1.0 Km from the Brussels Central Station. We took a taxi and it cost us 10 Euros. Our host Mario was absolutely wonderful. He communicated with me over the email and made me feel comfortable that the B&B would be open (the last check in time as per reservation was 7:00 pm) even though we were arriving past 11:00 pm. His response time to my emails was less than 2 hours. Our room was nice with all the amenities. The hotel has an elevator. Mario serves breakfast to all guests the selection is quite adequate.  We were able to get to all the attractions by foot.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. Not much to complain. Great place! Highly recommended. Check-in checkout personalized,10
wonderful spotless property with a beautiful large stylish room. Mario was very welcoming and gave us a great map with suggested places to visit and good restaurants. Nothing.,10
The room was spacious & well appointed. The host Mario was wonderful & cooked a perfect breakfast. ,9
Everything exceptional. Beautifully designed rooms excellent breakfast super friendly treatment. Location just a few minutes walk from Grand Place. Will definitely stay there again on a coming visit to Brussels. ,10
Mario and Art de Sejour are the best. Nothing!,10
This is an extension of our previous nights stay.  We had booked a total of three nights so this is the same review as our Friday night review..The reviews that we read before the trip were excellent and we found out why when we arrived.  The quality of the building decor food accommodations and owners was exceptional.  From the communications before the trip were friendly detailed and timely.  The interaction with the owners was extremely helpful at the beginning all the way to the end of our visit.  We wouldnt change anything about our time at Art de Sejour!  For us staying at Art de Sejour was one of the best highlights of our visit in Brussels! It was perfect.,10
We liked it all Mario and Ivan are exceptional hosts. They took great care of us during our 5-day stay in Brussels. When we arrived Ivan gave us maps and told us where to go based on our interests. Our bags arrived late and Mario received them for us and delivered them to our room. Every morning we had a wonderful breakfast with delicious food choices. Our spacious room was super comfortable with a great big bed coffee machine and food and drink items replenished everyday. We already miss Art de Sejour. ,10
The hotel was immaculately clean quiet and comfortable. Mario was a wonderful host and made a delicious breakfast for us. We have been used to breakfasts where guests help/serve themselves but this was a nice touch to have a host serve. Mario offered us a map for orientation to walk around the area and find landmarks and also provided a list of some recommended restaurants. We had a great stay at Art de Sejour! ,10
Where to start?   Tea and coffee at check in with Ivan.   Personalized map of recommended restaurants awesome room with a heavenly shower ( this was the third establishment we stayed at.. wish we could have spent more time here).  And breakfast..Mario started us with blueberry banana smoothie as a breakfast hors d≈ìuvre croissants yogurt and fruit.   And although I shouldnt have I had the smoke salmon too.   By far out favorite place.  We felt totally pampered.  And the dogs if youre lucky enough to meet them are adorable. That our stay was so short,10
Loved the feeling of total privacy yet knowing there was someone there to help you if need be. Everything was well thought out - from the coffee maker to the roomy spotless decor and warm lighting. It was wonderful to wake up to the aroma of rolls and croissants baking downstairs!  Would highly recommend this all my friends. Nothing,10
A stylish apartment very modern but nonetheless complementary to its heritage. ,10
This was by far the best stay weve ever had in Brussels. Traveling for work with a group of people of different ages and nationalities and everyone agreed on this. Everything was perfect - the rooms were super spacious comfortable and beautifully decorated to very last detail breakfast was varied all fresh natural and delicious and the host was amazing! Location very convenient close to major attractions and with a variety of bars and restaurants close by. We will definitely try to stay here again on our next visit. Congratulations to the host for an excellent job. ,10
Amazing super-friendly host - Nothing is too much trouble. Excellent value for money. A fabulous hotel in the heart of Brussels - A stones throw from the Grand Place & Manneken Pis. Would highly recommend this little gem! ,10
Breakfast was excellent and the host accommodated our departure time by making breakfast early. ,10
The proprietor is very friendly and tries hard to make his guests welcome. He will make breakfast the way you want it. The building is tastefully furnished.  It is an easy walk to the Gran Place and many the central station. ,9.5
Spacious and clean room.  Delicious breakfast.  Excellent restaurant recommendations. Nothing.,10
Bathtub breakfast location and of course host were just ideal ,10
There was nothing I didnt like about this property.  From the minute we walked in we knew we had struck gold.  The rooms were amazing the home cooked croissants and eggs at breakfast were amazing and Mario was an amazing host. Nothing,10
Exceptional service with attention to every little detail - breakfast design cleanliness and more. ,10
Everything.  There is not a fault in this magnificent B&B.  The rooms are spacious most comfortable and super clean.  The breakfast is amazing and served in a pleasant dining room.  Mario is an exceptional host.  He is very welcoming and helpful in suggesting nice restaurants and places to visit.  We cannot wait to go back. ,10
 Unfortunatelythe late check out was unavailable on the day of our departure. It was raining and cold outside .,9.6
The team were welcoming and efficient and accommodated my late arrival in a friendly manner I found the ambience relaxing and stylish with comfortable rooms and facilities. Breakfast was fresh and comprehensive served in style by Mario and the location is convenient for the major transport hubs and in an interesting neighbourhood. ,10
Lovely friendly service very stylishly decorated very comfortable beds and lots of attention to detail. Very nice tasty breakfast. The road is quite noisy but this isnt the fault of the hotel!,9.6
Everything! Beautifully presented room very comfortable bed lots of space amazing water pressure in the shower. Air conditioning (vital in a heatwave) close to everything and the most amazing host!  Nothing!,10
Great friendly host willing to show you the hotspots of Brussels according to your interests. Theres so much love in this place. Very tidy and comfortable room. Shower and batchroom facilities are perfect. Breakfast was nice too. Fresh bread and served by choice. A place to remember. ,10
Very nice modern and clean. Super friendly stuff fantastic breakfast  Nothing,10
Mario our host was delightful. The accommodation and hospitality were top notch. Breakfast was lovely. The decor bathroom and shower amenities orientation to the city - all excellent. Would absolutely stay again. There was nothing to not like.,10
Breakfast was made to order in view fresh smoothies every morning fresh made fruit salad plentiful croissants and crusty rolls all delicious Some rough sleepers in doorways nearby,9
Mario.  Gracious.  Welcoming.  Impeccable host. Everything.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,10
Style kindness cleaning. The rooms are elegant modern big and stylish. High quality breakfast. We allowed for late check out with no additional charge. We liked everything,10
Wonderful position next to the city centre.The owner is very kind and professional: couldnt ask for better About the B&B theres nothing that isnt excellent,10
Excellent location close to everything. The host gave us a little map and some dining recommendations that turned out to be great. I would definitely stay again. ,10
We loved our stay there everything was amazing.The host are wonderful the room is perfect! and the location is nice. Just 10/10 dont think twice before ordering this B&B - you will enjoy your stay there! ,10
Location excellent close to all places of interest breakfast was something to look forward to . Mario was the perfect host and provided us with a map indicating places where we  may like to visit. ,10
The reviews that we read before the trip were excellent and we found out why when we arrived.  The quality of the building decor food accommodations and owners was exceptional.  From the communications before the trip were friendly detailed and timely.  The interaction with the owners was extremely helpful at the beginning all the way to the end of our visit.  We wouldnt change anything about our time at Art de Sejour!  For us staying at Art de Sejour was one of the best highlights of our visit in Brussels! It was perfect.  No changes,10
Everything was perfect one of the best hotels Ive stayed at such a great nights sleep. One night is not enough!!  ,10
My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. We liked everything about this property. The first thing that catches you is the clean smell as you walk in the room. The architecture of the rooms are well thought out with tall ceilings and clean artistic designs. The towels smelled delicious. The second thing was the breakfast. The vitamin shots every morning did the trick. Finally the host Mario was the best. He guided us about everything. Where to walk what to see where to get the best beers and the best food. Our stay was everything we were looking for. Very relaxing. We will surely visit again.  ,10
Everything from the rooms breakfast and h Helpfulness of the owner was superb Nothing to add apart from previous answers,10
I cant say enough good. The decor bathroom and shower amenities staff breakfast orientation to the city - all excellent. That we spent only one night.,10
Large beautiful room. The photos did not do this place justice. We were blown away by how big the room was coming from a hotel in Paris lol such a great price/value. Mario was a lovely host as well! We would stay here again in a heart beat. Nothing at all!,10
Mario has renovated this property brilliantly. He is an unbelievable host who is caring and efficient at the same time. Our room had a very interesting bathtub which fills from the bottom rather than the conventional tap. The room was beautifully appointed and the back window looked into a garden where fairy lights lit up at night. The breakfast was individually prepared to each persons wishes and was plentiful and fresh. We would definitely recommend Art de Sejour to anyone who wants a five star experience in Brussels Nothing,9.6
Clean and spacious room and bathroom.  Amenities included luxurious bed linens towels and bathrobes.  There is a nespresso that makes delicious coffee.  Stocked mini bar.  Delicious breakfasts. We loved everything about Art de Sejour.,10
The host is very friendly accommodating and made certain everything was perfect for our stay. ,10
This is our second stay in Atrium and once again everything was perfect. Martine is a very friendly and helpful host. Location is excellent and the apartment has wonderful views over the city. The hosts have thought of everything to make the stay a pleasant one - comfortable bed wonderful terrace to enjoy the sunshine...we will be back again. Nothing - everything was perfect.,10
The bed was so comfortable and the terraces were beautiful ,10
Very Comfortable apartment excellent host and a few lovely little unexpected touches thrown in. I would highly recommend this property so much so I will definitely be staying again. I have no complaints,10
Tasteful clean and comfortable interior and spacious sunny terrace proximity to supermarkets stores and main square around the corner plenty of parking space in front super-friendly host ensuring smooth key handover and providing some treats and useful material & information on the region. Only minor things: parking in front of the house is partly payable though there is free parking 5-10 mins by foot away theres no dishwasher the hairdryer is too weak for some.,10
I travelled to Ypres as an Aussie especially to visit war graves and attend the Menin gate ceremony. The apartment is very comfortable with every facility and good wifi and at the centre of Ypres (important locations restaurants etc.). Parking in the street is free from 6pm to 9am and a couple of hours mid-day. Otherwise about one euro per hour. Very highly recommended (and not only for the warm welcome!) ,10
Martine gave us a wonderful reception and tour of her lovely apartment which is located 2 minutes walk from the main square. The apartment is spotlessly clean and very homely. The roof patios front and back meant we could sit out and take in the views in the evening and for breakfast. We would highly recommend this lovely apartment. All excellent,10
A very warm and helpful welcome from Martine. The apartment is lovely its so clean and comfortable with great balconies and stunning views of Cloth Hall. ,10
The two terraces overcooking the city were special we had breakfast on one terrace and some evening drinks on the other! Martine was so welcoming and we were touched by all of the extra little thoughtful things she includes. A great apartment to come back to after long days of cycling! ,9
This is an outstanding property in terms of location and what it offers. An evening drink onto the terrace was a bonus. This is one of those rarely found gems. ,10
I stayed with my wife for a period of 12 nights due to work in Ieper  and I am quite happy with the stay. The reason is this place is get high rating is that it has every stuff you need for a long stay (Kitchen utensils toaster oven coffee machine etc. ) but also that your Host really helps you during your stay. I mean to say they are genuinely in the business of service with assist you to things and information you need. It is this attitude that makes everyone welcome and happy to say. The location is equally good with options for car/bicycle parking in the street.  Overall we had a  very good stay . Nothing that would come it me. They take every step to make your stay comfortable,10
The location was amazing for exploring Ypres and the surrounding area. We enjoyed eating our breakfast outside on the terrace every morning. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The lift was very small. The hairdryer was very weak.,10
Excellent location! Short walking distance to the Grote Markt!Ideal apartment for a couple and a short stay!  A bad smell on the terrace,8.3
Excellent location only a short walk to all the major attractions bars and restaurants. Easy parking. Room was really good two terraces front and back overlooking the town. The owner could not have been more helpful and pleasant. 10/10. ,10
the location was first class..close to everything we needed we had to park the car a fair way from the apartment to avoid parking charges,10
Superb terrace views of Ypres. on both sides of the apartment. On top floor but has a lift for getting up and down. Nice and quiet . and very short walk to center. Spar shop just up the road for groceries  etc. Tv would have been nice if staying for more than a couple of days but thats all.,9.2
Fabulous apartment in a perfect location. Two beautiful terraces with lovely views. Well appointed and very clean. Comfy bed! Martine was welcoming and very helpful. We absolutely loved it. The hairdryer!,10
The apartment owner( Martine) gave clear instructions on where to meet and even met us outside the front of the property . Making this one of the most easiest arrivals we have had. The genuine warm welcome we received and the apartment itself helped make this the best holiday we have had in Ypres now our sixth year. The apartment was spotless and location with the added bonus of two rooftop terraces meant we had a very pleasant place to relax and unwind. ,10
Fabulous Apartment  right in the centre of town.  Wonderful facilities and a great  host.  Perfect  space for a brief stay  in Ypres  a really  high  standard of fixtures and fittings + a lovely  welcome package  of wine  beer and water.  Also two  fabulous balconies which  would be perfect  for a relaxed evening later in the year!  Cold and rainy  when I visited.. I genuinely couldnt fault anything if only  all  aprtments were as good as this!  Very much  look forward to  returning . Top  job all  round! ,10
We loved the apartment the location was just up the road from Cloth Hall and around the corner from Menin Gate. Martine was lovely and welcoming. Two terraces with nice views of old Ypres. It was perfect.  Street parking was expensive during the day but free parking was accessible for daytime and overnight on the street was free. So it was fine.,10
The view from the terraces are worth the money.   Location is excellent.   All the comforts.   I would recommend. There wasnt much to dislike.,10
Location was in the middle of the city and next to Antwerp Central Station Zoo etc. The apartment was spacious with two big king size beds. Staff did not speak English and was really hard to communicate. But maybe its my problem that I do not speak Dutch and French.. TV did not work and host couldnt get it to work either.  If you travel by car its hard to find parking lot. Only option was parking house a few streets away. Not  Bathroom was so small that you can sit on the toilet pot and brush your teeth at the same time.,7.9
We loved the close proximity of the appartments to Antwerp Central station. We asked for an early check-in the host obliged willingly. Idris our host was fantastic during our stay thank You for a pleasant stay The Place was very clean although the linen and decor may not be to everyones taste. Our weekend stay included Saturday which during the night was a bit noisy this may put some people off however this didnt spoil our trip.,8.3
location and size of apartment the stove didnt work,8.8
Was clean nice location very friendly staff  Needs some restoration,8.8
Cleanness location  There was no hairdryer in the property we waited a few hours till the reception gave us one.,7.9
Location is perfect. Apartment was clean and very nice no hairdryer :(,9.2
Very friendly and helpful host - thanks again! Central location close to Antwerps central station and about 15 minutes walk to the Groote Markt square in the historic centre. ,7.5
Location was perfect if you are based in Central Antwerp - 2 minutes walk from the nearest Metro (Astrid) and the bars & restaurants and 5 mins to the main station. We were based at the apartment for an event at the Sportpaleis which was a 25 minute walk or 5 mins on the Metro. Balcony was a nice added feature! ,9.2
Location excellent just a short walk from the railway station. Good sized apartment. Would really have liked bedside lamps.,9.2
Kitchen facilities were good. Induction stove and oven were functioning well. Two beds one in the common room like a studio and other bed is in a separate room. Good place centrally located near train station if you are with kids. Not very posh but convenient. Construction ongoing outside the apartment. Was quite noisy due to poor sound isolation. Located above a shisha bar and snooker/pool bar. So people were a bit noisy during the night or early morning.Although check-in is allowed from 14.00 hrs the apartment was not cleaned and ready. We were asked to come back in 30 mins.Need to call the number on the front door to open the door. There is a bell but probably it is broken.Bathroom shower is a bit small but otherwise everything is ok.,7.9
Location was great - it was very close to the shopping area and central station (a little far from sightseeing - about 25 minute walk). Host was responsive even though he didnt speak English. It wasnt kids safe. Furniture seemed flimsy and plugging in teapot shut off the power circuit in the entire apartment. We never received a replacement pot and there were no pots to boil water in. Also we were afraid to plug in anything into power outlets after that.,6.7
 Invoice missing so i left without having an invoice cause nobody at reception at 08:30,7
All though the host didn¬¥t speak English he tried his best to make us understand him and was very friendly upon arrival.  The appartment was very good certainly for what we paid. Awesome location yes there was a strip club next to the apartment but we didn¬¥t really experience any inconvience from it except a bit from the music at night. Good apartment to enjoy a city trip in Antwerpen for a small budget! ,7.9
The apartment was clean n kitchen facilities were fully available. Also very roomy with more than enough space for us and we had everything we needed. ,7.5
It was really nicely furnished. It was clean and comfortable. It was cosy. The breakfast was delicious with different croissants fresh berries cocoa etc. The surroundings were really cosy. The host was willing to drop us bystanders to the track. If at all - The roads leading to the place were a bit rough for low cars and people on foot a bit long walk to the track,9.6
The accommodation was excellent and very stylish. Everything was perfect would recommend to anyone ,10
Latest standard rooms all new. Very friendly owners. Best breakfast. A perfect choice ,10
really good breakfast clean new rooms and very friendly people -,9.6
Fantastic rooms. Very clean . Great for a short stay ,10
Very nice apartment in a lovely area. The apartment is new clean and with lots of light. The view is stunning and the owners very friendly. Highly recommendable!! ,10
Great location and very nice accommodation. Breakfast,9
Andre is really a special person! We have never stayed somewhere with such a kind and thoughtful proprietor. You see this both in the way he is with his guests and in every detail of the property. We had a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and big bathroom as well as access to the living room terrace and even a small lounge room that had a mini-fridge where we could put our wine. The entire house was spotless and full of personal touches. We also loved the surrounding area. Beautiful! We would definitely come back! Merci pour tout Andre. Vous etes genial Nothing!!!,10
Amazing breakfast and friendly owner. All was fine,10
After a warm welcome we were presented with a very spacious room. There was very sufficient central heating and a nice bathroom with a stand alone modern shower cubicle. The bed was big and comfortable with a modern quilt but with rather flat pillows.Theres a separate little room where one can enjoy a coffee in case you dont opt for the breakfast as we did.Unfortunately we didnt have the opportunity to communicate with the owner more as he seemed to be extremely friendly. He obviously takes great pride in his very well renovated house.  The only thing that cant be neglected are the squeaking floorboards. They may disturb partner or neighbours on a nightly visit to the loo.,9.6
Very friendly and helpful owners you book a family bedroom but what you actually get is the full house with exception to the shared kitchen. Value for money. Lovely garden position for walking and exploring the region. Children liked the chickens the little extra treats Netflix. We were also forgiven a little incident with a broken object.  The shared kitchen but keep in mind that the accommodation is room only so you really get a lot of extras,9
Great hospitality! Fantastic value for money! Good for visiting Rochefort or taking walks in the winter landscape! ,10
The family room we booked turned out to be two big bedrooms with 2 double beds a single bed and a cot. There was also a small room with fridge coffee & tea makers etc. We had access to a lovely terrace and a garden. It was peaceful for a real bargain for accomodation in the Ardennes. Be aware that the toilet is accessed through one of the bedrooms.,9.2
A beautiful breakfast lovely host very good rooms. We all slept well on very comfy beds. There was a lovely garden as well as living room area that we were allowed to use. ,10
Food is good - needs maintenance and upgrading of outdoor areas - not sufficient pool chairs and pool is surrounded by gravel and overlooked by busy parking lot and traffic as well as restaurant area. Ground floor rooms are dark and very basic - got a room on upper level which was better but still very basic in terms of appointment. Sewers were blocking and smelly during the night. Lots of maintenance needed not least for safety related issues: trip dangers  and dirty outdoors stairways full of bird droppings Hose pipes across walkways,5.4
High quality breakfast especially the yoghurt. Coffee was lovely. Great setting. Pool fab in the heat!  Old-fashioned fan in the room was great.  English - speaking waitress was lovely. Very little information on local area. Only map was $7!,8.8
Location the owner food from the restaurant in the hotel pretty clean hotel and restaurant. Bed is too soft in the middle  no water cooker,8.3
Breakfast was good its handy to have the restaurant there. The restaurant attracted a lot of afternoon drinkers so by the time we went for dinner we were going nuts with all the noise of drunk people. The rooms are good but the place is a little outdated.,7
good breakfast Internet not available in the rooms,6.3
We had a difficulty with communication but overall good. Breakfast was ok. We were expecting a hot breakfast and we got bread and meat slices ie continental. My wife is vegetarian so she couldnt eat any.,6.3
Fantastic location and clean rooms. I love the restaurant and normally have a great meal there unfortunately on this visit it was closed.,8
Beautiful property full of charm. Such a pleasure to just sit outside on the terrasse or in the garden and gaze into the green. Very spacious room with a huge bed (couple co-sleeping with a two-years old very comfortably). Tasty breakfast and delicious dinners albeit on the expensive side. Quiet location easily accessible and just around the corner from the start of hiking trails. All in all a wonderful stay and would go back!  ,9.2
Beautiful and charming auberge in wonderful rural setting. Picturesque buildings full of character with comfortable and tastefully decorated rooms. A true oasis of calm set in gentle countryside that invites for walks. Very warm welcoming and helpful hostess. Excellent breakfast. We also enjoyed a good dinner menu at the auberge. Would highly recommend.  Nothing,10
Very friendly staff and exceptional good dinner ,10
We arrived an hour to late for dinner but they served us the dinner anyways. We even got time to get an aperitif.  There was a quiche as a snack a starter a main course cheese and a dessert all together for $35 p.p. Breakfast an dinner were very good.  The people were very nice they even helped us to find a place of interest that is open on a public holiday. ,10
The owner was very friendly and hospitable. The 5 course dinner was amazing.  Centrally located and ideal to explore the environment. ,9.6
Position and breakfast WiFi scarcely available in room (bad because of poor GSM signal),9.2
The diner prepared by the land lady.  And not to forget the way they serve their guests ,9.2
Nice rooms beautiful garden friendly staff charming town. Whats mot to like? Could have used a fan in our room.,9
Hotel located i na nice park in a quite place. Staff is nice. The waiter in the restaurant was not a professional.. TV only displayed 3 channels the shower door was broken and there was no air conditioning in my room,7.1
Superb location into a green area. Staff is is always there to help organise the stay the meals etc. I believe that you get excellent return on the money paid. Pro tip: do not I repeat do not miss the deserts of the restaurant! Cannot go wrong with it! Honestly I do not think of any negative points that affected my stay. Everything was just great!,10
The location (the hotel itself is really nice and placed inside a beautiful park) ,9
Beautiful and quietly location. Big room. Very clean. Nice breakfast I would give the sheets and the floor a more contemporary look that will make the room much nicer.,8.8
Nice Hotel with a five star restaurant. Location is also very close to town center. ,9.6
De locatie Housekeeping started knocking on the door 2 hours before check out,7.1
Everything in this hotel is marvelous! Wonderful design pleasant staff comfortable rooms delightful courtyard and delicious breakfast. I could go on and on.. Somebody could say that it is far from centre but the area around August is so calm and beautiful that you dont need to go anywhere  ,10
Great Hotel very cosy and comfortable good location. +++ for the breakfast excellent. room a bit noisy,9
This hotel gets nearly everything right: stunningly renovated historic building set in amazing grounds beautiful and comfortable rooms very accommodating and friendly staff yummy food and a gorgeous bar in the old chapel.  Note that the hotel is somewhat outside the city centre: the central market is 30min walk. Spa access should be included in your hotel stay - and absolutely when you book a treatment. To ask for $70 access fee to the spa when you already booked a massage is rather outrageous..,9
Everything. Literally nothing it is just awesome.,10
The bed and sheets. The breakfast. The shower / bathroom.  The bar.  History meets design.  Clean and modern with an ancient touch. Check out was a bit quickly handled.,9
Everything else They dont help.you carry your luggae to your room,9.6
Excellent breakfast. Attentive Friendly and professional staff ,9
amazing rooms great bar friendly staff. ,10
A fabulous hotel with lovely staff. Great linens. Beautiful building and rooms. Quiet and serene. Access to steam and sauna facilities are not included in the room charge.,9.2
Excellent breakfast. Very friendly staff good conversation and received tips for visiting Antwerp.Excellent welness.Cozy rooms clean all you could want. You have to walk through the bar to get to the rooms.Expensive private parking. ,9
Besutiful tranquil atmosphere. Amazing architectural conversion so a joy to stay somewhere with such good will and serenity. l ,10
Great breakfast and very nice and friendly staff. ,10
Great location in beautiful district in Antwerp. Very friendly staff and very pretty hotel. ,10
Location design facillities I found 1 hair in the shower join arrival,10
Great location amazing kitchen very modern and clean. Host very welcoming. A bit too warm only 1 air con for the whole 2 store studio located upstairs.,10
I was amazed by the design and good management by the owners. The house is equipped with everything you need. And it is very cosy and relaxing. ,10
A great host thank you! He met us on the street at 10pm and helped bring our things to the apartment. The property was so clean - absolutely spotless! It was a lovely little haven to enjoy at the end of the day. It had a very nice atmosphere with the mezzanine and with sweet bird and cherry decorations. He even left us some beers in the fridge which was a lovely welcoming touch. The photos dont do it justice! My partner had to sit in the bath to take a shower as he was too tall to stand in the bath to take a shower.,10
Spotless. 100% equipped. Cozy. Looks brand new!! Just to mention something here..the bathtub was a bit uncomfortable,10
Thats a gem - stylish clean cozy fully equipped convenient apartment close to very center of old town. Every detail in this apartment is made with love and care. Free parking at Place dArmes GPS 50.253565 4.916901 200 m to walk. Perfect place to stay and discover lovely Dinant. Hosts are extremely helpful and kind many thanks to them! ,10
I really like evertything there! Functionalities and beauty of the cottage. ,9.6
We came to Autrefois chez Lina for our first weekend in Dinant. We were pleasantly surprised by the accomodation. We were greeted by a friendly host and welcomed into a perfectly equipped and very clean gite where we felt home immediately. We really enjoyed our stay here also because of the location close to everything. Until next time! ,9
The location the staff and the great food. That we had to leave the next day.,10
Location welcome accomodation of motorcycle parking clean room great bathroom lovely food pleasent surroundings. I could not find fault at all. Very happy to have stayed here.,9.6
In a beautiful setting. Well kept inside and out. Super restaurant too. Very friendly Nothing not to like,9.6
We received an email a few nights before that the restaurant was fully booked by a group the night we would stay. When I called and explained we were hiking to the location they made room for us and we were able to eat the set menu selected by the group. It was beautifully presented and delicious. We were very happy they could accommodate us this way. ,10
The accommodation is at the 2nd floor of brasserie within the nicest rural area. Its perfect to stay there if one is traveling by car.Dinner in brasserie could be also recommended. ,10
Beautiful location.nice room. Pressure to buy breakfast,7.5
Just in one word everything! The diner the breakfast the location the hospitality ..the local beers the atmosfeer..just everything!!! also one word Nothing,10
Didnt eat the breakfast offered Elevator could use some fine tuning in its starts and stops!  A very eccentric elevator.,8
Amazingly kind staffBlond lady is extremely sweet and helpful Ventillation system of bathroom was dirty and ceiling of bathroom was destroyed with mildew. (At some point understandable because of the climate of the area but could be better maintained) room 32,9.6
Very good breakfast very helpful people good location but not directly at the beach. Excellent bed. Calm. Location not directly at the beach but very close.,9
The breakfast was delicious! Whole hotel is clean perfect wifi connection and all staff were helpful and completely lovely I will 100% stay here again Nothing,9
Friendly welcome accurate information nice room worth the money overall very recommended Public parking is nearby but ridiculously expensive.,10
The staff is very welcoming and helpful. The reception is designed as a tea table where the manager welcomes guests. The atmosphere is very friendly. The room itself was very big with a balcony with a nice view and a super cozy and soft bed. Room was clean and had everything: from towel to ! coffee machine yes your own. Exceptional quality for this price. Thank you very much Peter!  The hotel is conveniently located near the beach. The area is calm and seems to be safe. There are many restaurants on the seashore. I would really recommend this place. that we stayed just one night in this cozy place. I wish we could stay more.,10
In mid-season the price is very nice. The sealine is in 3-4 minutes walk. Some shops and local restaurants are nearby where you can see a lot of locals not just tourists like in city centre. The reception is very friendly the check-in and check-out were fast and without problems. No ventilation in the room and very bad ventilation in the bathroom that is why it was quite wet and too hot. The spare balconies do not give a lot of comfort. The beds are too soft and you hear all the noise in the corridor.,7.1
Room was really nice and comfortable. The road is quiet and food is available nearby. There was an espresso in the room super cool. The sink was kinda blocked. I requested at the reception but no one cared that kinda ruined the experience a little bit because if youre paying $107 per night.. Everything has to be perfect.,7
bed was comfortable The hotel itself was dirty and the room was very small noting like the pictures on the site.,5.4
Comfy bed coffee machine and small fridge Check in at 20.30 hrs... Entrance door was locked and we had to phone first to get somebody to open. Parking at nearby hotel.,9.6
Breakfast was really good   Clean rooms   Service was very good   Nearby the beach ,8
Location Rooms were smaller than appeared in the photographs,6
Because of a discount we got an extra large room (and a free breakfast + two extra beds). The room was comfy enough with a view of the back garden (and the fire brigade close by). Bed shower television and room temperature were ok. The design of the room is modern and quite clean. Breakfast had enough choices. The location is good as it is close to the beach the kusttram some shops and restaurants. You could hear talking from the other rooms for part of the evening. Luckily it was quiet enough at night.,8
The breakfast was amazing with a great buffet and a bit of everything. The staff were super friendly and very attentive. Its a short walk to the center and the tramstop is just about 100 metres away. Beach is very close as well. When we return to Oostende I will definitely consider booking a room here again. There was a bit of dust in some corners (on power switches light switches). Nothing major but still noticeable.,9.6
Clean nice staff great location Nothing,9.2
The room was very clean cosy and with plenty of space and a big sized double bed. The breakfast-service offers a wide range of choices. No one has to leave on an empty stomach. The hotel is situated nearby the beach and offers parking possibilities. I can not even mention minor dislikes.,8
Great position..lovely helpful staff. highly recommend ,10
The location The shower was such a bad idea and no one can shower witihout touching the shower curtains. There is no way you can adjust the shower height or angle of water.  The Coffee machine did not work.,6.3
 We liked our stay in the hotel but our room was not ready upon arrival although we arrived one hour after the check in time.,7
The fine hotel location and the room is rather comfortable ,10
Breakfast: nice morning welcome everything fine and safe brasserie with art deco details good breakfast! ,8
Bright and comfortable rooms with nice balcony. Perfect location beach and the restaurants are walking distance. The breakfast has a bit limited choice but still quite enough. ,9
Room was clean comfortable and roomy. Breakfast was good. Only problem is the lack of parking. Best to use offer to park at near-by hotel as local public car park is $25 overnight.,8.3
Wifi was good. Access to beach was 1 block away.  Tram was less than 1 block away. Had adequate food at breakfast. Appeared a little run down.  Needs paint . Had Stained table chair and bed linen. No windows to open. Balcony door did open however this balcony is open for others to walk into. 1 broken chair on balcony. No eating in room but had fridge . Parking was 3 blocks away. Constant notice from fire department.,6.7
The bed is big and comfortable. The manager lady was friendly and helpful. When the TV did not work she sent a person to fix it immediately. The room without air conditioning was a bit warm during hot days. Wifi was fine during the daytime but almost not working in the evening.,8
The bed was the most comfortable Ive slept on in a hotel! The dark room helped for a nice sleep. The noisy people at 4 am!,10
Comfy bed. Very good breakfast Good location. Helpful and friendly staff. ,9
Been here before 3 times and has always been great used penthouse. This time given family room as 4 people in apartment 47 and sofabed broken so now no sofa had to sit on bed which takes up the whole room and no space to move!!!,6.3
Takes some finding you will probably pass it the first time. Nice parking area just outside. Good sized room nice bath mini-bar also available. Clean and cosy.. You will hear road traffic from outside but there are not too many cars during the night.,8.3
The hotel met my expectations. The location is nothing particular on a main road with easy access by car. Friendly and helping staff. The room was great comfortable bed and pillows nice shower and bathroom large desk TV chairs and plenty of light. The room temperature was easily adjustable and the window opens. The room is not well isolated its like the walls are made out of carton! I could even hear my neighbour yawning in the morning! I had an early wake up call good thing I had earplugs and noise reduction headset to fall asleep..,8
Clean comfortable  Expensive for such a level of hotel Fridge was  not good in hot weather you cant even cool down some warer.,7.9
Reception personnel was very helpful.Good parking . Treadmill slightly worn. If it will be fixed :),8.8
Good selection of food for breakfast. The restaurant food was absolutely awful over priced only one choice of wine and football playing on the TV. The walls are so thin we could hear someone snoring all night so very little sleep for us,5
Nice rooms with everything you need Really great breakfast! Bed not very comfortable Food in the restaurant clearly too expensive for what you get.,7.9
Excellent location.Had proper parking and didnt have to the ourselves up in the Brussels roundabouts. ,8.8
clean bathroom standard cold in room too expensive for this standard poor breakfast (at least for vegetarians),5
Location off the beaten path.  Free parking and about a 3 min drive to erps-kwerps train station that also has free parking.  Inexpensive way to get into Brussels and points beyond.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Would recommend and stay here again. ,9.2
breakfast was good the staff very friendly the heating did not work propperly when we arrived at night,6.7
Cooked breakfast.easy parking Room a bit too warm,8.3
 This hotel is great if you travel by car. On booking.com I searched for hotels near airport with shuttel bus. This hotel came up although it does not have a shuttle bus (only if booked through a travel agency). This is misleading. It cost me 43 Eur to get there from the airport and 37 Eur back to the airport by taxi (40 minute ride in the morning due to traffic),8.8
It is close to the airport so perfect for overnight stay if you have an early flight. ,8.3
Rooms clean and comfortable. The restaurant is closed Friday Saturday and Sunday. This should have been highlighted instead of being in the small print,6.7
clean room airco close to heavy traffic road pretty much nois with room at front side No good chairs in lobby to drink a beer. Frniture old fashioned and not comfortable.,7.1
The staff was very cordial and helpful. It was a very relaxing hotel environment. ,10
Hotel is a recommendation for short stays close to Brussels. And away from busy environment. Very nice staff breakfast and dinner. You have to pay for coffee and tea on your room. Maybe an idea to make serve without costs.,8.8
Good breakfast with fruits good room free parking A little bit expensive and far from airport,9
Very friendly welcome comfortable bed good sized desk hot shower iron & ironing board in every room early breakfast - good selection of food. Without a car there is a 1.2 km walk to the nearest restaurant.,9.2
 The price of 17$ for a breakfast buffet is normal but not for a breakfast served on the room. This price should be adjusted.,8
Quite and comfortable place to stay for your business trip. The food was delicious and the staff was really kind. There is no direct city transport to the hotel. The hotel is about 20 min away from the airport by car if there is no traffic (typically for the time between 5pm till 8pm) otherwise it could take you more than 40 min.,8.8
Nice clean room. Just 20 min walk to city center. Great breakfast in stylish brekfast room. No problem with parking. ,9
B room are built in a former brushes factory split over multiple businesses. Each has its own building but altogether creating a wonderful tiny secret and quite neighbourhood only 5 minutes away from historical centre of Bruges. B room is surrendered by a top class restaurant and owner knows plenty of excellent addresses. He refurbished the whole place by himself to make it a wonderful loft in which five bedrooms are proposed. He is delighted to his visitors breakfast he prepares is just amazing. Parking is free and located on the site. Bikes are also available. Overall B room is the Best room. Nothing,9
Loved the cool decor the unusual building the incredibly welcoming hosts - Zoe and peter- the abundance of light. Great breakfast. We had a very relaxing stay which was so good given the stress of the current situation around the world. I would recommend anyone to stay.  Nothing,10
The building is gorgeous and the interiors are very well designed. There are plenty of areas to hang out and the bed was really comfortable. The breakfast was great (tons of options and catered very well to my vegan companion). Netflix subscribtion was available on TV and they offer affordable bike rentals. Toiletries provided were also exquisite. We would have liked a little more information before our arrival or during the check-in process. We had to ask other guests the wifi password and were not really sure which common areas we could use.,8
The building is extremely unique clean modern amenities and well-maintained. The breakfast was excellent with several choices and particularly healthy choices (meats yogurt fruits pancakes coffee - our host even made his own gravlax that was very tasty!).  Peter our host was extremely friendly and talkative. We had many great conversations over breakfast and he made our stay that much better! The bike rental available on site was very helpful to get into the old Bruges city and there is free parking for vehicles on-site. The bathroom was very clean and modern but did not have many toiletries (only basic handsoap and handcreme). Luckily we had our own soaps and shampoos/conditioners but a few more toiletries would have been nice :),9.2
Everything! The place the hosts the atmosphere..    Peter and Zoe were super welcoming and friendly. We had a super great time out there We struggled a little to find somewhere to eat. They helped us out it was really good. Nothing to say,9
everything was perfect friendly hosts perfect breakfast and cosy appartment to find the adress,10
Fabulous base for exploring Bruges taxi into square ¬£10 euros or a nice walk about 30 mins just strolling. Very clean modern  and well presented throughout full continental breakfast with fresh coffee and Orange Juice Peter was very friendly and accommodating highly recommended  Only draw back for me was at 5ft tall it was a climb up and out of the high beds but it gave us a giggle,10
The breakfast was top of the top. Everything was very fresh. Prepared with the smallest details. I even discovered the best cheese in the world (damse mokke). If you close the curtains - its completely dark (just how I like). If I would say that the owners are great - I wouldnt even say half of the truth (they are really friendly and super polite). Parking is free the charging station for EV cars is within walking distance. We were missing an air-conditioner but luckily it wasnt that hot at the end of May.,10
Such a beautiful place! Great breakfast! ,10
Location  friendly host.  Breakfast was very good. Parking was good. Interesting place to stay.  Bikes were available to tent at a very reasonable price.   Couldnt turn the heating up in our room.More soft furnishings would have warmed the place up a bit like a couple of fleecy blankets.  ,9
Fab organic breakfast friendly hosts. Great location. It is a one mile walk into the central squares so far enough out to be quiet and to have free parking but near enough to walk in. You can also hire bikes for 5 euros if you like. ,10
Zoe and Peter were very helpful and their warm hospitality made the visit even more unforgettable. Highly recommended to travellers who love artwork and appreciate simplicity. The breakfast was amazing and delicious with abundant choice. Zoe even provided extra information on how to enjoy Antwerp for one day!  Lovely host with wonderful spirit. Zoe packed 2 pieces of chocolate cake made by her mother for us to enjoy on the road ‚Äî priceless souvenir! The sound insulation was a bit poor from other guest room but it didnt affect our good sleep at night.,9
Pete is a seriously amazing host. The best thing besides Pete was the design of the house the beds and the breakfast! we loved hiring the bikes and riding around it was the highlight of our trip.  Nothing,10
Our hosts were fantastic breakfast good choice although we did our shopping as well in nearby grocery shop as we stayed 4 nights and wanted to try local food We could use the large kitchen anytime so making a sandwich or eating our cake was easy also coffee and tea were not restricted and we used the fridge to store what we bought Room #2 was clean the bed comfy overall good stay We got clean towels daily which we found a nice feature We found the wall insulation thin we could hear everything next room or the rooms below,10
Breakfast was very nice. Regional and less waste. Peter is a wonderful host. The rental bikes are fantastic to exolore the City. Highly recommend this b&b ,8.3
EVERYTHING!! Stunning location right next to the canal parking facilities which were free and on site late check in and breakfast was delicious! Literally every food you could think of! The waffles and bacon were awesome!  There was nothing that we didnt like! The owner was lovely the room and building were amazing! The facilities were brilliant and nothing seemed to be a problem! ,10
The owners were very helpful and friendly.  The accommodation is very cool and in a great location and topped off with a lovely breakfast. ,10
Interesting architecture & very friendly owner. Bike hire fantastic value for money. Wonderful restaurant next door but one. ,10
I went B.room with my husband for a couple days. It was the best bed & breakfast experienced weve ever had. Location is great owner of the hotel is great breakfast is great! totally recommend! ,10
We read the comments before coming to Brugge so expectations were high but they were more than met. Extraordinary interior which (in our opinion) is a perfect contrast to the old city center of Brugge. Peter is the perfect host. Lovely breakfast.  Zero,10
Comfortable apartment.  Much better than hotel room.  Very well located for European quarters. Few Irish bars nearby. Quiet location Tear wear signs. Smells,7
Everything was just as expected.  The rooms were fine. Although I like the bathroom to be separated from the bedroom. There was nothing I didnt like.,9
The apartment was nice like an office but nice its Bruxelles. The breakfast good and the staff friendly . The Ambioirix square and the surroundings is a good place to stay. A bit off for easy handling with credit cards. I found myself after a long day driving giving my card to the girl at reception. Dont do that.,8
Well located Needs to be refurbished and a system for contacting in the weekends.,7.1
The second room I got was very nice and quiet. Rooms feel a bit dated but are generally clean and comfortable. Location and breakfast was perfect. The airco was not working and it can get really hot in Brussels.,9
Only stayed overnight. Ideal location if you are travelling for EU missions in the area. ,7
Very good location easy check-in procedure Bad noise isolation .. we were disturbed during the night by the neighbor (there is just a single door separating our apartment from the neighbors one ..) two light were not working .. so it was difficult to work on the office (office light broken!) and not pleasant at all to eat on the bar table without any good light above us .. and to light on the bed which made it impossible to read in bed before falling asleep ..!,7
Laundry machine is possible to use with free of charge. Narrow parking,8
Clean nice neighborhood relatively close to city center  No staff on weekend No luggage storage ,7.5
The room was spacious with separate lounge bedroom and bathroom. Well located for the European area and a easy walk to the metro and mainline station. Plenty of local shops and restaurants with 6 minute walk. Fixtures and fittings are a little dated. There is a hob and microwave but an oven/grill would have been nice for this length of stay. This is just picky though as I will happily stay again.,8
 Problems getting a credit refund for wrong breakfast charge - it took more than two weeks to chase them on this matter,7.9
Location Old furniture carpet. Not value for paid money.,6.3
 The air on/heating we couldnt work it out made the room a little too hot,8
All excellent but some dust existed on the upper shelf! The magnetic keys presented some malfunctioning. The existence of a spare magnetic key saved the situation. I have some questions about the efficiency of the magnetic keys as well as for the cleaning of the carpets.,8
The appart was good snd spacious They toke the money twice from my account and i had to call many times for them to fix it,7.5
Room equipment and neighbourhood with the goodies you may require to buy for an upkeep. Didnt need transportation to visit work places. Just walked in and out.  Self Check-in quite challenging. No one physically present at the property to help at that time. Had to struggle on telephone outside in an unfriendly weather condition. Imagine if l didnt get the check-in directions by mail or lost them or had no credit to call immergency.,8.3
 Too much parfum in hall and on steps second floor in door scratch of floor and make noise,9
Good and comfortable location comfortable room.  The furniture is little bit too old and the cleanlenessis doubtable but all in all it is ok.,8
I called the service Manager cause of a little problem and sent someone to sort out the door in between 2 rooms within 5 mn on a bank holiday thank a lot to sort it out s fast ,8
Separate bedroom appreciated. Very spacious apartment for 2. Furnishings a little dated. Especially carpet which has 2 iron burns and many cigarette ones.,7
Nice apartment at a convenient location next to Schuman. Spacious place with a kitchenette. Very practical for longer stays. Friendly staff. The bed is not comfortable and so are the pillows. Its an important minus to an overall positive impression.,7.9
big appartement and well designed when i arrived i didnt find my key card.,9.2
Efficient service and large spacious room.  Check-in procedure was well arranged and easy to follow the instructions. Central location but not too crowded or busy and only about 15 minutes walk to the centre.  A fair number of bars restaurants cafes located very close within walking distance. We stayed over the weekend so no staff were present (this we knew in advance so isnt a criticism).  However things like the coffee machine only had two coffee pods for two people for two nights - there are no refills available and no one at reception to speak to for example about this.  Also the kettle coffee machine microwave and lamp all shared one plug which doesnt seem safe or sensible.  Again small issues but easily avoidable and not an expensive cost.,7.1
The room and WC are wide and clean. Kitchenette well equipped. Excellent location. Although theres no reception personnel check-in process is very easy. The parking spaces are narrow. Big cars could have trouble there.,9
Lovely spacious room no noise great location. The coffee machine didnt work.,8
 Only 1 key card. Not practical when 1 go out and need a key for lift access.,7.5
Very nice flat . Too much black marks on the floor and the wall of the white room . That was sad also the kitchen sink was leaking. And tv only 5 channels.,6.7
Location Spacious rooms  Old furniture Not Super clean Complicated and late check ins (from 2 pm) ,7.1
The decoration was good but some things like the sofa you need the change Not reserve tower,7
The location was greatThe check in process was easy and hassle free There were not enough luggage storage keys or space. The pillows were not very comfortable. ,6.7
There is no reception. Always available but they send you an email with the details to enter the building get the room of the apartment.. Also the apartment is very spatious. The cleanliness could improve. There was a LOT of dust in the bedside tables. The bathroom had a huge patch of humidity that they could take care of. Finally I would have expected them to refill the tea/coffee facilities.,5.4
Big flat nice kitchen and quiet during the night  The bed is like a trampoline so difficult to sleep with someone else in one and the same bed. Please change the mattress. It is not comfortable at all. The toilets door is transparent. No privacy when you use it.,5
Ilike the hotel it was nice.i stay for 1 day but its worthit. For sure i will be back again amd ican recommend it to other travellers.Ilike the hotel securities as even though there is no receptionist still its safe as no one from outsider can enter the hotel as the lift requires the hotel key to enter. ,10
Excellent apartment large with fantastic shower and good bed. Nespresso coffee ,10
The mirrorsThe bed The kitchen  One sharp knife Small binNo cutting board,7
Very spacious room. Only a 15 min walk from centre of town. There was a very potent smell coming from the drains in the bathroom. Room is a bit run down.,6
The location and the modern style of rooms The strong scent in the corridors,9.6
Room was great and hotel was a minute from a metro station Showered leaked filling the bathroom and apartment,8.3
The room was very comfortable and clean. Lots of wonderful memories. I will be back. The description said that there was a couch. There was not. Also a stove top would have been nice.,8.3
Located right opposite of a metro station (Madou) and easily in walk distance to the city centre. My room (N¬∞25) was pretty large. Staff was friendly. Obnoxious irregular beeping sound during the whole night made it rather hard to get a good sleep. The room furniture seems to be rather old and used. It seems to be mostly clean but most furniture is covered in stains and scratches. Using the shower flooded half the bathroom. Breakfast was pretty basic and unless included in your rate not really worth the extra charge.,5.8
The room was spacious and well appointed. I especially liked having a kettle! ,8.3
Location was great. Bed was comfortable and it was handy to have on site private parking even if it was 15euro per day. Building and bathroom in particular could use some repair and renovation.,6
The apartment was very beautiful and the location was very central 10 minute walk from Grand Place.  Supermarket close by and other cafes and restaurants Some of the equipment in the gym did not work and there was no reception so to ask a question you need to send an email and not always efficient in answering.,7.1
 The whole procedure of getting in for the first time was very confusing and the initial code given was wrong or deactivated. Difficult over-the-phone communication (in order to check-in) due to street noise. Noise from the neighbors.,8
For similar rate you can get something closer to Gran place. This property though good is quiet a distance from the center. Location was little far from center. Also since no reception no one to guide you if you are arriving for 1st the in a new place.,5
I didn¬¥t use breakfast service. I had problem to prepare my food I asked for a kitchenette you answered that there was one but a small stove was missing and the capsule coffee maker did not work.,6.7
Beautiful place so comfortable. Stayed for three nights and got a free upgrade on the room. Would definitely recommend! Nothing,10
spacious room a bit tired could do with some freshening up and a thorough clean,3.8
not included but the restaurant was very good especially the waiter the bathroom was need a constriction,9
Its my second time staying. Good size apartment clean and nice location. Would recommend. Not a huge issue but late check out wasnt available as the office was closed.,8
The room bathroom are super clean and location is very good. Near the supermarket and metro. Also near the city center. ,9
Location decoration and the place was really clean.  The code to enter wasnt the right one so I had to call them and ask for a new one.,8
The property is in a good location with easy access to the Metro. It is clean and comfortable. Very difficult to locate by satnav for some reason. Breakfast was a total waste. A drinks vending machine would have been perfect for guests checking in late. Was trapped in the shower for about half an hour but didnt really get an apology for it lucky I had my cell phone to call for help!,6.3
Clean pleasant & in city-centre. Unusual experience since theres no reception its self-service check-in & out ) Got confirmation from booking.com but didnt get confirmation code from hotel property (actually I needed it for entering & checking-in to my number) - eventually helpful girl on the phone managed to help me  :),9
I liked the fact the bed was comfortable and big The blow dryer wasnt working,7
Fine breakfast service The basic internet is realy crap. Lost connection every time. If you want to work you are obliged to to pay for the upgrade of your internet. Thats not ok.,8.3
very friendly hosts. delicious breakfast. very comfortable bed. silent room was not cleaned up between the two nights.,9.2
Very comfortable place to stay in Lommel. Nice room comfortable bed. Great food in de restaurant. ,10
The room has been outfitted with so much attention to detail and is located in a beautiful setting next to the Cremehuys cafe. The booking includes a fabulous amazing over-the-top breakfast and the owners are so attentive and friendly without being at all intrusive. Couldnt ask for more. Really we were pleased with every aspect of our stay at the Cremehuys bed and breakfast and certainly plan on visiting again the next time we are in the area.,10
 Maybe some extra heating in the bathroom during cold days,10
The hosts are really nice friendly and welcoming. The rooms are quite and the interior is selected with much attention to details. I really enjoyed my stay their and would recommend it further. ,10
Beautifully furnished room with great attention to detail very friendly hosts and amazing breakfast! Very close to nature & hiking area. Definitely worth it we would stay here again for sure When the parking is already full with restaurant guests there arent many options to park off-site we got lucky but I can imagine it could be an issue ,9.6
Very warm welcome with free coffee at arrival and super breakfast with extras for the birthday of my wife. Very nice room and bath room. No remarks really,10
This was a lovely and warm place to stay Nothing,10
Beautiful room nice accomodation good bed I prefer a douche One window with no view (a wall),7.5
Lovely room an honesty bar and a great garden to enjoy your beer in. Easy transport links into Oudenaarde and easy access to fantastic cycling. Loved our stay. Highly recommended.  .,10
I recommend Paulette restaurant at walking distance really cozy innovatinve and refined yet easy environment. ,7.9
Perfect stay for business and private purposes with a delicious breakfast. ,10
The room was spacious and tastefully decorated. There was a sofa in the room where we could sit in the evening to relax with the spectacularly good Belgian beers. We brought our bikes and kept them in the owners garage for security. Just around the corner from the B&B is a the Kattenberg climb to warm you up. The countryside and river track are close by for cyclists and walkers. The restaurant Paulette (5 minutes walk) is outstanding and not to be missed. The host Katrien is friendly welcoming and helpful. We stayed for five nights and could have stayed longer. This is an outstanding B&B and wed love to come back. Nothing,10
This is the first time stay in a B&B hotel it was very cozy :D ,10
Nice and friendly host and quiet new room. Internet ok parking space on property. Coffee and Thee available in the room. None,10
Amazing! Kindest host quality breakfast cleanest bathroom with wonderful bath. Quiet beautiful farm area. Will definitely come again. Everything was perfect! Thank you so much. ,10
 I was welcomed very very friendly and the room was comfortable I could rest well. I had a good breakfast this is a good start for a working day.,8.8
Friendly staff good fresh breakfast silent neighbourhood- perfect for recover an relax after long day. ,8.8
Very nice and quiet surroundings.  Very good bed ,8.3
The location is very beautiful and peaceful. The hosts are very friendly. Very clean rooms kitchen and bathroom with a bathtub. Perfect place to stay both for work and holidays.  ,10
Superb B&B a little off the beaten path but easy to find and well worth it.  The Hosts were very welcoming and helpful apartment had excellent facilities very clean and comfortable beautiful views and very peaceful look foward to staying again in the future. ,10
Everything was terrific! Laurent was a wonderful host and gave us great recommendations. He was available at all the right times and gave us his mobile # in case we needed anything during the day. The property was walkable to the metro and many of the places we chose to visit. The  room was very quiet at night and the bed was very comfortable.  We will definitely stay here during our next visit to Brussels! ,10
very friendly host helpful and responsive ,10
It is a very beautiful place with alot of nice details. I really enjoyed the quietness of the place and the fact that it is so close to a nice restaurants. Nothing.,9
Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and adequately spacious room. Facilities running well. Excellent location close to Schuman station ,10
Mr. Scholtus is very kind and an excellent host! Thank you for your hospitality! ,10
Great place! Really enjoyed the breakfast and the host is absolutely fantastic! Thanks for the great experience ,10
very nice cosy apartment well organized. The host was very nice and carefull to guest needs. ,10
Very convenient place and very friendly owner. Can definitely recommend it. nothing,10
I had a Wonderful stay super cute Little B & B. Thank you very much Laurent! If I should Need a home in Brussels again I will definitely come back. ,10
The owners were really nice friendly and helpful. ,9.6
Lovely place comfortable and clean. Staff very welcoming. Nothing.,10
Furnished and styled beautifully. The owners were very helpful and friendly. The room was well heated and very spacious. It was spotlessly clean. Very quiet - great nights sleep. ,9
Clean and very comfortable. Host superb - very welcoming and accommodating. Super breakfast with fresh coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. ,9.6
Clean friendly staff Cold and heating not working properly.Shower not working properly ,6.3
It was great to be in this acommodation. Wery good location close to the European Commision and the hospitality of the owner was really nice. I would like to fully reccomend you this place. ,10
Really personal service a good sized clean and comfortable room and freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast! Great value for money. ,9.2
Very nice very quiet there was everything I needed. I liked in particular the shower beneath the birch tree. ,9.2
I highly recommend this place if youre working at borchette. Laurent went the extra mile to make sure I had everything I needed ,10
Super nice B&B with super friendly host delicious and healthy breakfast and nice and quiet room! Definitely will be back!  ,10
Very friendly hosts. Nice breakfast clean rooms and quiet during the night. I had a very nice stay. ,9.6
very nice small property very close to the park and nice restaurants around. Very kind owner. ,9.6
Parking is free in front of the house. The breakfast was quite ok not on hotel level but good selection of food. The surroundings is nice with calm atmosphere. We were welcomed nicely by the host and explained everything. The room was rather small with very poor sound insulation. We heard every passing of other guests as if they were coming through our room. The bathroom was not very clean and is quite small. We came late in the evening (end of August) and the room was cold. Good thing the host left us a small electric heater that solved the issue quick. But floor is all of ceramic tiles so this remained cold for the rest of the night.,5
It was great to be there. We only had one issue. Its just a remark maybe its nice to put new towels every day when people stay a few days.,9.6
Amazing breakfast really friendly staff beautiful location and lovely atmosphere ,9.2
The very warm welcome from the landlord the spacious rooms and bathrooms. The upstairs kitchen and patio were full of charm too! We would have enjoyed locally made jams!,9.6
Everthingverry nice peoplecleangood place for relax! ,10
Easy to find between Brussels and Gent. Clean room breakfast included. Above theres a public area of dining and kitchen. Only one chair in a family room. The family room is not that big perfectly for a couple but 3-4 people would be a little narrow.,7.5
Everything was excellent the bed could be firmer wire based are ald fashion. The beds,10
See above. I loved this B and B! We were very warmly welcomed! The location is great slightly off the beaten track so not touristy as other parts of Bruges are. We left out car at the free car park at Coisseaukaai and caught the shuttle bus to Annas. The room was quite hot on the top floor but by opening a window it soon cooled down. The Vlissinghe pub nearby is very atmospheric and does great  beers. Central Bruges is a short walk away.,10
Very quiet location 5min Walk to the Burg. Opposite a lovely church that is well worth a look round inside !! Great selection of food on offer at breakfast and hosted very well by Anna. Would look to stay again. ,10
location is very good in the center of the city the owner is very kindbreakfast was good  there is no door between the main Room and the bathroom,7.9
Great location. Welcoming and informative owner. Amazing breakfast. Lovely room. ,9.6
Nice clean room close to everything. The bathroom is very lovely. ,10
- the room was very wide- the breakfast was delicious- the staff (Anne) was very kind- quiet neighborhood - we stayed at the 2nd floor with no elevator and the stairs were really narrow i believe that they might be very hard to use by someone with reduced mobility,9.2
All was good. Very nice clean and friendly. ,9.6
Breakfast = Excellent Location = Ideal. The hospitality of the host Anne. The spiral staircase was not made clear Pre-booking (I dont think). Anyone with any mobility issues would find it either impossible or very difficult.,9.6
Everything! Just need a door to the bathroom!,9.2
The property was really cosy and nice and in a great location quiet but close to things. Anna was extremely helpful and the food she put on was varied and of good quality.  There was nothing I didnt like about Annas place,10
We like the elegantly decorated interior of the B & B. We particularly enjoyed the wonderful breakfast and the bathtub. The mattress of the bed is so light that it moves and the wooden steps to our first-floor room is steep which make luggage carrying difficult.,9.2
Delicious breakfast and friendly service. ,9
Great location lovely owner delicious breakfast with a healthy selection of fresh fruits ,10
Anne was extremely friendly and welcoming she even bought my wife a cake on her birthday! The location was perfect- walking distance to the centre and the property was always clean and home-yWould definitely come back! N/A!,10
Great breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice by non other than Anna herself!  Anna is very friendly and offered to buy  for us flowers that we wanted for our family friends in town.  Lots of chocolate goodies in bowls to pick from.  Location is great very close to city center and right next to a great historic church. Very steep spiral staircase to floors 1 and 2.  Mitigated by Anna herself hauling our baggage up and down.  Paid street parking near the facility is a bit difficult to find.,9.6
Lovely B & B in a quiet pretty area of the city within walking distance of all attractions.  Anna the host was very welcoming and helpful.  Very nice continental breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice. There was nothing we disliked.,9.2
Anne is the best host ever always with a smile :) . The room was nice clean and cutie with a beautiful view to a square. We were so happy :) ,10
The 2nd time at Annas and it was wonderful. The room is spacious the breakfast very lovely and the hospitality shown by Anne just wonderful. Anne got in contact prior the arrival day and send us recommendations for the parking. She greeted us and explained the B&B and the surroundings. The room is wonderful we had the room with twin bed option and the bathroom is huge. The breakfast is delicious fresh cut fruits a delicious selection of cheese and ham / sausage and different cereals. Anne offered fresh orange juice which was very refreshing. The location is perfect - a 5 minutes walking distance to the old town. Close to shops restaurants and bars. Just the perfect getaway! ,10
The B&B is simply perfect! The location is great and the B&B itself is nice and cozy. Anne is a great host and provides an extremely delicious breakfast. ,10
It was a wonderfully calm place. Breakfast was excellent. Anne was a superb hostess with lots of useful information about Brugge. The house was in a superb location. We will look forward to returning. Nothing!,10
Very kind and helpfull hostes. Delicious breakfast. Nice and silent surroundings with only 5 minuts to the center. The staircase to the rooms is rather steep.,9.6
The hosts were great. This is a real B&B where you feel home while having your own space and privacy. Amazing!  Everything was perfect,10
Very helpful hosts excellent breakfast beautiful and comfortable family room relaxing garden. ,10
The housholder was very friendly   and the breakfast was delicious. ,10
Extremely nice and clean rooms super tasty breakfast very nice owners great location perfect views. Definitely worth a visit. ,10
Very nice and clean room with wonderful beds.  Great and large garden.  Excellent breakfast. The bathroom was a little small but it was clean and provided everything we needed.,9
The room was very cosy and nicely decorated.  The breakfast was excellent : healty local products and rich breakfast. ,9
The hosts are very friendly the rooms are fine and clean. The breakfast offers many choices and everything was delicious! Communicating was sometimes a bit difficult the host is not speaking English very well. Even though he tried and with some help and some French words you will manage to communicate.,9.6
First of all we loved the hosts. The warm welcome care openness and sense of freedom. The love for heritage and books. Second we loved all about our stay starting from a superb breakfast exploring the surroundings and resting in the house. The old is mixed with new and there is a scent of an old welcoming house. A house with a character.Third we love the aftertaste of our stay. We keep smiling and we will return. Actually it is weird to write so much good and then hope that we will be able to find a slot to book again and bring our friends. But we need Katleen to keep spreading this happiness because she makes this world a better place. With love Maija & Jan ,10
The old ambiance in this magnificent chateau surpassed all expectations . and so did the organic and very tasty breakfast. Extremely welcoming hostess! We will certainly come back to enjoy the old atmosphere and culture and good taste - -and the fruity breakfast with delicasies from neigbouring farms ,10
The atmosphere the location the authenticity the quietness and the kindness of the hosts! Thats not counting the amazing breakfast prepared with love and care with everything either home-made/homegrown or locally sourced!An amazing getaway to relax and breathe in peace!  ,10
Beautifully refurbished old house without disturbing too much the original the host was just delightful gave me a tour of the house (they also have a beautiful library) the breakfast was just amazing with delicious home made jam bread waffles and locally sourced cheese and ham. Since I traveled in the middle of the pandemic Kat adviced me that all restaurants were closed but still offered me a delicious vegetarian lasagna and a desert. I cant praise this place enough. Hopefully Ill be back in better times. 5*!P.S. I traveled with my dog and there was no problem to accommodate her. They also have a beautiful very large garden.  Everything was perfect.,10
Best breakfast ever with regional products and homemade goodies. Very hospitable owners + charming place Nothing,10
Wonderful place.  Waking up with the sound of the birds.  Best homemade breakfast ever.  Friendly welcome. ,10
Stayed in the annexe which used to be an old chapel full of character. Fabulous breakfast and hosts were great.  Stairs were a bit steep,7.5
Beautiful hosts that made us feel very welcome ,9.6
Katleen is a wonderful host she suggested me things to see and served a very special home made breakfast. Room and bathroom were huge and well decorated there was a sauna in the bathroom and a relaxing view on woods.  ,9.6
Amazing house and rooms lovely breakfast. Kathleen is a great host. Nothing the only slight improvement might have been a kettle in the room,10
Ample and well furbished room and large bathroom. It wasnt very warm outside when I arrived and I really appreciated that the room was already heated when I arrived. The hosts are very nice and provide lots of information about the area. The breakfast was extensive and made of home made or local products. The property has a library and very nice garden that are free to use. Not many restaurants in the immediate area but with a car reachable within a 10 minute drive.  Regarding the property itself there is nothing to improve.,9.6
Everything!! The grounds room breakfast but most of all Katleen! The best night sleep in 2 weeks in Europe! It was a fantastic find!!! The pictures are after our stay but so wonderful!! I would absolutely stay here again. ,10
Quiet beautiful comfortable friendly The bed,10
The breakfast was fabulous and the hosts very friendly helpful and welcoming. We had Atelier room which was fantastic and comfortable. Their property was so quirky and full of old furniture but displayed tastefully and with modern touches. Would definately return here. Katleen and her husband Chris were so helpful and made us feel at home straight away thank you so much xx Nothing everything was wonderful.,10
The vintage feel the nice host and excellent location.  ,10
The host Kathleen was the best host I have ever experienced so helpful and spoke very good English. Slept so beautifully as the area is lovely and quiet. The whole B&B was so cosy and romanatic. The breakfast was so delicious a lot of it homemade. Loved having a sauna in the room. Just could not fault our stay at all and would definitely stay again if in this area. ,10
Kat ‚Äîyou are wonderful!!  Thanks so much. ,10
We liked everything  not least  the hostess and the butiful decorated house.The homemade breakfast  was outstanding. We and our small dog will hopefully  be back. ,10
LocationVery friendlyHouse is beautiful ,9.2
Its personal its cosy and in a large country house among sloping hills.Lovely place with welcoming hosts that make connections to all guests.The real grandeur has gone  but loads of charm and character have remained.If you like a snoring fireplace and an homemade breakfast among a dozen of other benefits this is the place to be.Large rooms comfy beds good WiFi and local produce sum it up.Dogs more welcome than young children is also worth something nowadays..More books in the house than anyone can read in entire winter so bad weather will make you read from paper again.. Anyone not liking this place prefers chain hotels and all-inclusive travel solutions probably.,9.6
excellent host great breakfast the building has character bathroom was spacious but not very practical,10
Friendly host fantastic location. Spotlessly clean accommodation. Lovely breakfast each morning. ,10
Very friendly welcome. Sparkling clean. Location is great still central but off the tourist path! Furnished nicely The room could be a bit warmer but it is difficult to totally heat the old buildings. It was not cold but rather lukewarm,10
Exactly what I expected. Incredible hosts ,10
Everything was perfect starting from the delicious breakfast amazing and comfortable room impeccable staff and perfect location in the historic city center. Benny was an incredible host!If one day we return to Brugge for sure were gonna stay in B&B Bariseele!  ,10
Very tastefully decorated spacious and a delicious breakfast choice with a chance to sit and chat to Benny and guests in the dining room on weekends. Easy walks to explore the UNESCO old Brugge! It didnt worry us but there are a few stairs up to the top floor but very quiet up there with a nice view of the church!,10
Everything was fantastic exceptionally clean Benny couldnt do enough for you it was like home from home great location to explore Brugge may I suggest arranging parking with the B&B/Hotel as street parking is metered.  Nothing,10
the place is really cozy makes you feel like homeits spacious and warm. 10min walk to centre. ,10
Had a wonderful stay room was a really good size with everything we needed while the neighbourhood was very quiet. Our host Benny was very attentive and put on a really good breakfast every morning with lots of locally sourced produce and even bespoke waffles and pancakes :) He answered all our questions and set us up well for the day whatever plans we had which was much appreciated. Highly recommended. Having to leave both the Bariseele and Bruges..,10
From check-in to departure everything was excellent. The room was lovely the bathroom exceeded expectations and  we loved the convenience of all the amenities in the room.  Every comfort was thought of to make our visit a special one. ,10
It doesnt get any better!We had the perfect stay in this B&B extremely friendly host superb room with great view super close to everything by foot. Wish I could give more than 5 stars!! ,10
Wonderfull large room in quiet area in old Brugges and close walking distance to the city center.Benny went the extra mile to make us feel at home and the personnalized healthy breakfeast served in room is something very special to enjoy. Availability of a garage and 2 bikes to rent made our stay particularly easy from all aspects.Thanks a lot Benny for your service and customer orientation. ,10
Our welcome was exceptionel ! Warm warm welcome. The room was very beautiful and romantic. Nice clean perfect! Benny was The Best host we have ever meet!  Everything was perfect !,10
Beautiful and historic feel. The staff were amazing helpful and friendly! They have put a lot of effort into it! Beautiful breakfast in bed to top it off Ill be back to stay again  Cant fault it,10
Very quiet place yet close to the old town. A very helpful owner who treats each guest individually. We spent a week at the hotel taking advantage of the active rest on bikes. And there are countless routes around. ,10
Breakfast is taken with the owner of the BnB and the other guests the atmosphere is homely welcoming and is such a great day to start your day! Food was plenty and of good quality. ,9
The proprietor Benny is a very gracious host. B&B Bariseele was everything we had expected. The breakfast was without a doubt the best we have ever had at any B&B we have stayed at anywhere. The location is about a 10 minute walk to the heart of Bruges as well as some of the more suburban areas of the city. We highly recommend B&B Bariseele! Nothing I can think of!,10
The service is great the breakfast is delicious and the owners are just best. We were provided with everything we need including map directions recommendations discounts etc. There was nothing I didnt like actually.,10
Fantastic house in fantastic location. Historic centre is all within walking distance ,10
The location is perfect close to everything and at the same time private enough to feel secluded in a historical site. Benny is a superb host kind and pro active. The breakfast is delicious and the room is tidy and clean. Finally the bikes are in perfect condition and at hand. ,10
The location was good and very central. The property was exceptionally clean throughout. Benny was always friendly and there to help at all times. Breakfast was marvellous with fresh and different items everyday. Definitely B&B Bariseele in Bruges is the best property we had in many years abroad. Surely we will visit this place again shortly. Thank you Benny.  NOTHING,10
Great location a few minutes walk from the main attractions and a supermarket nearby. The property is clean comfortable and offers ample space (we had a living room and a bedroom). Staff is welcoming very helpful and makes everything to make you feel at home (they even let us checking early as there was a snow storm when we arrived). And the breakfast!!! Despite COVID measures they make sure we could enjoy a wonderful breakfast basket put outside our door in the morning. Wifi is a bit weak and was not always working,9
The breakfast was amazing .Beautiful decor hosts so very friendly and welcoming beds really comfortable. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay would highly recommend it. cannot fault it,10
We had a lovely stay here - the hosts were very welcoming and joined us for breakfast in the morning. They made something special to eat every day and gave good tips about the city. The room with the terrace was great we could enjoy a break in the afternoon before heading out to the city again for dinner. Its in a peaceful and charming neighbourhood not very central and it made for a pleasant walk by the canal back to the room in the evening. ,9.2
Good breakfast location parking under hotel balcony friendly service The floor mats they need grip material so they dont move on the slippery floor,7
Clean modern and stylish. Very friendly with secure underground parking. Room was spacious and well appointed.  Nothing,10
The breakfast was amazing! The room was a little warm for me personally during the night.,9.6
We loved this place.  In a trip that was over a month this was our favorite place.  Its like staying with your favorite aunt and uncle who love to spoil you.  The room was lovely bathroom the same bed extremely comfortable could have been in a very fine hotel.  Free parking under the house very convenient especially in Brugge.  But the best thing was the breakfasts which were lavish and never the same from one day to the next.  AND there was a dessert each day.  For breakfast. Nothing,10
Its a fantastic hotel and you are made so welcome by Marie and her husband. Nothing to dislike,10
It was clean in an excellent location and the food and hospitality was fantastic ,10
Marie and her husband were fantastic at every point in our stay - staying up late for our arrival to the incredible breakfast spread and even walking us in the right direction of the centre! We couldnt have wished for a better stay. The rooms were incredibly clean and comfortable. ,10
Fantastic b&b. the hosts were fabulous. highly recommend it. Everything was 10/10!! Will definitely be returning. Nothing,10
Great location five minute walk to van eyck square. Facilities are immaculate. The hostess went out of her way to orientate us to Bruges and suggest an exploration route even walking with us along to  a main Street. Superb breakfast. We would always stay here in future. Streets are narrow in the old town. There is plenty of parking but one needs to drive with care to the parking under the building. But thats only on arrival we would always choose this BnB.,10
Lovely couple who made us feel very welcome. Lovely room with great breakfast and the location was fantastic. ,10
Very comfortable room and within easy walking distance to the centre. Car parking available. ,10
Very friendly & helpful owner. Excellent variety and quality of breakfast with a special dish each day. Very sociable ambience with family style breakfast Nothing,10
Bed is very comfortable. Female Owner is very friendly. There is a home made beer brewery next to the hotel so you can ask for a small tour on the production of beer for free which is very interesting to me! And their beer is must-try in Brugge. None.,9.2
Big room very clean comfortable bed excelent  tasty breakfast beautiful living room and terace. 20 minutes nice walk to city center. Privacy of the bathroom,10
Staff were incredible  Delightful atmosphere  Fantastic beer in honesty bar  Gave us extra parking  Not a single negative ,10
Stayed in Bruges for a few days. A wonderful small hotel with cozy rooms and a very convenient location. Incredibly hospitable hosts delicious breakfasts. It was sad to leave this wonderful place. ,10
The owner is extremely friendly and customer oriented. The location is also good (walking distance to downtown) and it has a parking (not easy to find in Brugge). ,9.2
Nice cosy old townhouse newly renovated and located in walking distance to the ancient centre of Brugge. The guest house is a nice quiet location where you easily can relax.  A spacious living room and terrace can be used by the guests and  antique furniture is supporting the boutique style. Very good homestyle breakfast with homemade juice and honey and delicious bread croissant and buns from the nearby bakery. Our host Charlotte had been very caring and attentive making us feel home right from the beginning. We really loved our stay and will surely be back in the future. Many many thanks to Charlotte .. ,9.6
The room was very big with a big and comfortable bed and the bathroom was new and clean. Very nice and tasty selection for breakfast too overall I felt very welcome and comfortable. The owner is incredibly lovely and will help you with anything you need.  Its located in a quiet area about 15 minutes walk from the city center. ,10
Very nice hotel clean very tasty breakfest and very nice personal. I support this hotel. 5*  ,10
Charlotte and her husband Kristoph are great hosts. Charlotte provided an excellent breakfast and went to great lengths to accommodate our coeliac friend.  Comfortable ensuite rooms with a lovely lounge/dining room and garden for common use with the other guests in the three room B&B.  Excellent honesty bar from their brewery next door. Kristoph has extensive knowledge of brewing and is happy to share - both verbally and by tour if you are interested. We were! They also have a tasting room in the brewery that opens as a low key pub on Saturday until 6.  B&B is on the route 4 bus into town that goes to the train station too. A wonderful welcome and an excellent stay. We will be back! Nothing - we could have stayed longer than our 4 nights!,9.6
Tasty breakfast Very interesting brewery close to the house Very comfortable bed. ,8
Fantastic 2 days in Bruges. Our hosts were always on hand if needed from providing an efficient check-in to comprehensive instructions about parking directions into town and places to eat. Bed and room was very comfortable. The breakfast selection was amazing! great start to both days with plenty croissant coffee and cheese :) plus homemade apple juice! They are next to a brewery but didnt get a chance to try the beer this time. It is a good 20/25 minute walk into town and nothing really to blame on anyone - just something to be aware.,9
The owners were super friendly and went out of their way to make us feel happy. Delicious breakfast every morning while we got loads of useful information on the city. ,9.2
Charlotte went the extra mile for us and dropped us off at the bus station AT 4AM!!! She also waited for us with the AC on (we arrived during a heatwave). The rooms are extremely clean the breakfast is rich and accommodates any need (even gluten free). The house is lovely within 15min walk from the heart of the old city (nice evening stroll) but there is a bus station in front of the house if you choose not to walk. Visit their brewery and try all their beers theyre excellent! ,9.6
Very clean.Easy location to find and have access to BrugesThe hosts.Quality of breakfast was incredibly good. Parking was easy close and free.A real example of how a B&B should be run. You cant fault this place. You really cant.,10
Very good breakfast and location in the center of Kortrijk great hospitality of the owner. I fully recommend. ,9.6
Lovely place full of personality and very clean. The best is the kindness of the owner the cosyness of the place and the gorgeous breakfast. We will definitely get back everytime we stop in Kortrijk. Everything was great there,10
Beautiful breakfast and friendly hostess. Good central location I was very surprised that there is no door on the en-suite. I expect to be more private on the toilet ! Also the stairs are steep and difficult if you have reduced mobility,8
My room was comfortable and staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Location was perfect - 10 mins walk from the station and just off the high street. Whilst the bed was comfortable the pillows were rather hard.  The Moroccan feel to the B&B was welcoming and very authentic but this meant that the lighting in the room was very low.  It would have been nice to have a slightly brighter light in the bathroom for example.,7.9
We have been in Casablanca a few times before and it it always clean tidy easy for check in.   Will definitely go back more. ,9
Short walk from the train station. Really nicely decorated and with everything you need in the room (hairdryer kettle etc.). Host was lovely! Such a friendly place to stay. Highly recommend! Everything was good!,10
Lady was smiling offered teas beers etc. but when you are in a bad mood you just want to crash. Especially after not being answered the door multiple times. Lady does not speak english. Check in is at 16:00! New one to me and the check out is at 10:00 if you consider the time in between I might as well sleep on the street.  Nobody was answering the door was ringing for good 15 minutes. Prior that I visited the property 3x times nobody was there (in hopes to leave the bag so I can go around the town) ended up carrying all the stuff with me to the exhibition that I needed to see.  Very bad money driver will not choose again!,4.6
Very comfortable B&B just 700mm walk from the beach. Room is very nice. An excellent breakfast was served in our room (still corona restrictions). The Rituals bath products are a nice treatment. Owners are very friendly and helpful. Nothing.,10
Central located friendly clean free parking super breakfest ,10
Conny was so friendly and opened her house to us nothing was too much trouble Parking was a slight problem.,10
Beautifully furnished clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was amazing Conny has thought of everything. She was so friendly and welcoming and always on hand to answer any questions about the local area. Would definitely recommend to couples and families.  ,10
Only one word: PERFECTThank you Conny Thank you Steve! See you in Erfurt No.55  -,10
Breakfast was very lovely plenty of food fresh coffee orange juice and fruit. Absolutely impressed. The room itself was clean and very spacious and the Ritual products in the bath room were a very nice touch. Owners were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend! ,9
Steve and Conny are very friendly and helpful. Nice and cozy room and walking distance to a nice beach. Wonderful breakfast. We loved this place. Thank you very much for your hospitality! Nothing.,10
Lovely decor crystal clean fab breakfast and great central location! Would definitely recommend. ,8.8
Beautiful little place perfect location and friendly staff.  ,10
The beds were comfortable the room was lovely I would definitely stay again ,10
My wife and I loved this place. Very well located. The owner was great and prepared amazing breakfast everyday. We stayed in the suite and it was very comfortable and cozy with the fire place. Will definitely book this place again if or when we will return in Bruges! ,10
We liked the convenience of this location in proximity to the shops and main square.  The property is decorated in a clean modern chic with relaxing earth tone colors and tasteful furnishings and artwork.  Stephanie rode her bike to the property to meet us and explain the key system etc. in a timely manner.  Parking our car in a nearby garage worked out well and the location was walkable for all of the tourist areas of Bruges.  Breakfasts were beautifully displayed and we had a lot of carb options to pick from as well as freshly prepared eggs.  Overall it was a lovely choice for our two-day visit to Bruges. ,10
The coziest B&B in the heart of Bruges! Well decorated with an amazing included breakfast. ,10
Location is ideally suited for a Bruges visit All good,9.6
Fantastic accommodation excellent breakfast lovely hosts situated in town centre ideal location loved our stay Nothing,10
Superb room - friendly welcome and absolutely amazing breakfast. Perfect location for seeing Bruges ,10
Everything! The location is fantastic - city centre close to everything but also quiet. The room is outstanding! The breakfast is very very good! The staff is friendly and very professional! Chester B&B clearly exceeded our expectations - is much better than you can imagine. For the price you never will find better! Thank you for everything. Nothing!,10
The breakfast was lovely plenty to choose from even offered a glass of Champagne with it. The location was perfect close to the market and the many shops. We would recommend the B&B Chester and would certainly return if we came to Bruges again The room we stayed in was excellent the only draw back was the steep stairs.,9
Everything was just as youd expect it: location room great breakfast. We had the perfect spot for our weekend getaway! nothing,10
The B&B is overall beautifully decorated and our suite on the ground floor was very spacious and very pretty. The fireplace was simply amazing and created a romantic atmosphere in the room! The honesty bar was very well equipped and prices were very reasonable. The breakfast has a lot of variety and it was quite tasty. There was quite a lot of noise from the street the stairs and the door of the B&B which sadly is the case for many hotels in cities. The bathroom was a little bit smelly. Breakfast was served by a different person every morning and although everyone was polite it felt a little bit impersonal. ,8.8
Excellent breakfast Fireplace in the room Very nice welcoming and service Wonderful modern interieur design Superb location right in the city centre ,10
A beautiful place - conveniently located cosy and comfortable. Would love to have stayed longer.  ,10
Loved the stay. Dimitri was very helpful! Always felt like home. Staff outstanding thanks again to Laurenz! We ll come back for sure ) ,10
Great central location in the middle 9f Brugges.  Very comfortable rooms and nice buffet breakfast.  We were able to leave our bags at Check Out in the morning them collect them later in the day. Nothing,10
Breakfast was fab - lots of variety fresh & plenty of it even a glass of bubbly too.  Our suite was beautiful the fire was just what was needed after a cold day & the shower was fantastic. The room was exceptionally clean & well maintained clean towels on both days too! The location was great everything within a short walking distance. Nothing!!,10
Everything about this place was beyond anything Ive expected - couldnt be located more centrally and yet in a quiet square so you dont get any main street noise the amenities and the room itself were incredibly high standard clean and well thought through. And the breakfast.. I have no words we were in heaven!! Overall I will never look at any other place to stay when in Bruges. Nothing to say here,10
Everything. There was even a carafe of water in the fridge. The location is perfect. Its close to everything but its located on a quet street. I had such a good sleep just amazing. ,10
The welcome from Stephanie and the information given.The spaciousness and comfort of the room. The location was excellent. The choice at breakfast was very good. The fact that we could leave our luggage there and collect later. There was nothing to dislike.,10
Everything thing was great Theres nothing to say,9.6
Central to Mons with charming hosts.  This is an interesting old property with traditional features and excellent ensuite modern bathroom and modern kitchen. Francoise and Robert were excellent hosts.  We could easily walk round Mons from this property. ,9.6
BREAKFAST GREAT!!! Everything excellent but stairs up to 2nd floor.,9
Excellent breakfast. Excellent location. Spacious and comfortable bathroom. Friendly hosts. We just missed the doudou festival ),10
Location host breakfast room. Nothing.,10
Close to the train station quiet location very nice hosts great breakfast with homemade ingredients huge bathroom. ,10
The owners spoke excellent English and were warm friendly and inviting.  Breakfast was very good.  The room allocated was large comfortable and full of character.  I would use this B&B again in any future business trip to Mons. ,10
The location was perfect nearby the main market of Bruges. The B&B is in a quite street there were no nuisances at all. Room and bathroom were perfect and very clean. Breakfast was above expectation. Nothing.,10
The decor was perfectly cosy but also contemporary and clean. Kathleen was amazing so friendly and helpful! The facilities were gorgeous and the perfect place the relax particularly the lounge area. Wed definitley return! ,10
Great location nice & clean rooms feeling very comfortable and friendly staff.  ,10
The decor was utter luxury whilst also being homely & comfortable. The breakfast was so lovely that I - a non breakfast eater even on holiday - stuffed my greedy little face! How could I not when presented with such an array of goodies a fruit bowl including pieces of kiwi & passionfruit yoghurt & granola scrambled eggs toast waffles danish pasties a cheeseboard cold cuts of meat little bars of chocolate cereals tea fresh coffee fruit juice and bread rolls. We were offered a glass of champagne but unfortunately I was too hungover to consider it.  I can not recommend this lovely hotel highly enough. Nothing could have been better.,10
Everything !A stunning B&B the staff location comfort and a champagne breakfast !  Nothing to dislike in my opinion .,10
Everything. It was all superb. Nothing!,10
Good location stylish very good breakfast Would recommend a room garden side as room street side suffers from noice from the street,8
Location - close to centre Very stylish accommodation Comfortable and welcoming ,9.2
Style and location Sunday breakfast staff not as good Kataline who was awesome.,10
Kathleen the host was fantastic we arrived early and she checked us in at 11.00 am the room was ready she then provided a map and informed us about all the sights and gave us directions. Room was a great size really comfy bed and breakfast was fantastic champagne for brekkie!!!! Gorgeous high ceilings and lovely courtyard. Road noise at night and a bar further up the road had revellers singing and shouting.,9.6
Beautifully appointed converted 3-level residence.Spacious room with large comfortable bed and modern bathroom.Attentive courteous and professional staff. Nothing.,10
Everything.   Location excellent   hotel quality excellent staff excellent. Parking is an issue but there are meters outside BUT IN NO WAY DOES THIS DETRACT FROM THE STAY AND THE HOTEL.,10
Close proximity to all attractions well kept apartment in an old house which was an art gallery. Coffee and tea making facilities were included and a beautiful breakfast was included daily. Kathleen went out of her way to make us feel welcome and also gave us some recommendations on what to see in a limited amount of time.  Nothing,10
The bed breakfast decor Kathleen.  Lovely place. Room a little small but bed and linens great. ( Room #1.)  Also No CNN channel so couldnt get any US news.,9.6
Reception: very friendly and good explanation of the facilities of the B&B and places to see in Bruges. Breakfast: excellent good variety of products and excellent and friendly service. Location: cannot be better and even parking turned out to be not a problem (maybe we were lucky..) Very spacious room and all amenities present. Shower is a bit small and it would be convenient to have something to place the shampoo and shower gel on. Hose of hand shower needs replacing. Other than this everything was fine.,9.2
Very classy clean beautiful space. The staff was kind and helpful. Breakfast was great!  The location was close to but outside of the busy touristy part of Bruges convenient to all sights and wonderful restaurants. We would highly recommend.  ,10
All was superb it is the fourth time we have stayed and id the go-to choice in Bruges for us. The weather.,10
very nice location 5 minuets walk to center Kathleen is very kind and helpful i would come again for sure ,10
B&B Bornedrager is a gem! Low-key sophistication greets you upon entry. The restoration of the townhouse & the refined decor is lovely. The hostess Kathleen wants to make sure that you have a wonderful stay not only in the B&B but also in Bruges. She is very helpful regarding sites & Tours. Breakfast is wonderful: eggs cooked to order cereals juices fresh yogurt fresh fruit cup sparkling wine if you would like it. Cheeses meats a variety of breakfast breads Etc. Our room was large & lovely with tea/coffee maker fridge safe. Comfy bed & upholstered chairs for reading. Bathroom is large and has modern furnishings. The location is terrific: you can walk everywhere. This B&B is a gem! We stayed for four days and loved every moment. Thank you Kathleen Nothing!,10
Attention to detail made feel at home  Nothing it was amazing!,10
Everything was perfect beyond expectations. Very close to the centre too! ,10
An exceptional property renovated to high standards. The rooms were furnished with style and careful consideration for comfort..the bed and the luxuriously appointed bathroom a real bonus.  Located on a quiet country lane amongst nature. Wonderful opportunity to explore further by bike. Everything was beyond expectation a wonderful stay.,10
Super excellent couples Bernard & Martine host an excellent dream house other than a normal B&B. Great breakfast with homemade cakes bread and jams. Its the best B&B we ever stayed. Just one last word....SUPER None,9.6
Amazing B&B in rural Belgium. Surrounded by field views perfect for a quiet and peaceful stay. The house has the WOW factor everything has been completed to a high standard is immaculately clean and modern. My room was large and very spacious. The owners are delightful and super friendly.  Everything was perfect! Would highly recommend! ,10
Great place beautiful garden quiet excellent accomodation great hospitality and very well presented breakfast.  Risk of traffic jams on the busy hours if you go to / from Brussels.,9.6
Very friendly Host. Large room with very nice bathroom. Clean and warm. Contact with the owner very nice and easy. No problems at all. Coffee water shower gel available and free of charge. ,10
Nice house with amazing view. Room very comfortable. Delicious breakfast ,9
Clean perfect location friendly staff.  None,10
The rooms are extremely well decorated and the breakfast in beautiful dining room was nothing short of exceptional. The location was perfect for those with a car perfectly situated between Bruges and the Belgian coast. However the best aspect of this property was the wonderful hospitality. We were made to feel extremely welcome and comfortable. Wed highly recommend this property to visitors travelling through Belgium.  The property is perfect. The only issue we had was that we travelled during a highly unusual heat wave and as with most Belgian properties our room was more adapted to cooler weather than hotter weather. Not a criticism - as I said the property was fantastic - but a fan would have been handy. ,10
Everything was fabulous. Christine was an excellent host and the breakfast was excellent. Highly recommend this place. ,10
Amazing place with beautiful nature. Christine is very kind and hospitable. We had a pleasant time. The room is stylish and made with love. Breakfasts were super fresh and tasty. We will miss your horses. Hope to come back soon)  ,10
Excellent breakfast beyond any expectations. And I mean both for food and atmosphere. Lovely landscape friendliness and relax. Just to make De Vossenbarm perfect Id suggest to improve acoustic insulation of the rooms. If other clients move during the night it is not perfect.,10
Well positioned for my proposed itinerary.  Excellent breakfasts. Informative and helpful hostess. Cannot really think of anything!,8.3
Breakfast was fantasic Beds (but that is of course personal) were way to soft for my taste. Lots of animal noise. We were woken up by a cow at 7 who did not stop.. but that is of course the country side,8
We opted for a place outside Bruges to stay away from the crowds and our choice couldnt have been better. The b&b is located just outside town and ideal to explore also the beautiful countryside specially if you have a bike or rent one. But it was our host Christina and her warm hospitality together with the exceptional breakfast she served us that made our stay really memorable. (She also provided us with all we needed to know to move around the area) ,9.6
It was very nice and a great place to stay with our two kids. The owners were awesome. ,10
Really beautiful place! Room was large and comfortable and it had everything you need to have a nice stay. Nothing to say.,8.5
Extraordinary location!!A recommendation from us for all who wants to have a stay near Brussels.You should book incl. breakfast as this was so great. Rooms are clean and decorated with love and pleasure.The train from Kortenberg takes only 28 minutes to the center of Brussels.We booked just for one night to stop before travelling further.Joris and his wife were so kind and did everything for us to feel comfortable.Thanks a lot. ,9.6
Close to the airportCharmingBeautifully decorated Cozy and spacious enough with the big garden.Decent place to eat and until late a short walking distance awayFacilities and a variety of bears if you want to.Host were very welcoming and cooperative.Suited our needs 100%. NothingOr maybe just the fact we wished to have more time spent there than we had..,9.6
Located in the town center of Erps-Kwerps in close proximity to restaurants and shops Nicely designed and furbished guest apartments with everything one possible could need ,10
Cosiness. Very nicely decorated. All fine.,10
Amazing hosts brilliant decor throughout the main house and the suites fabulous breakfast. ,10
The standard of accommodation is as high as you will find anywhere. The owners are friendly and welcoming and provide a superb breakfast. Nothing. Everything exceeded my expectations.,10
Location comfort and cleanliness of the apartment is excellent! My family and I stayed in the Africa suite and we loved it! It reminded me of home. The host was very friendly and helpful. Thank you Adinda! Well surely be back! ,10
We did like everything. You feel like home just with an extra comfort. Perfectly suitable both you go with family or with friends. We stayed in africa suite and loved so much the style of that. Very unique design B&B. .and thank you again for the welcome chocolates ) ,10
Very comfortable and great for a family with kids.  Nice compact kitchen to prepare simple meals. The owners thought of everything for our convenience. The Wi-Fi didnt always connect and cut out a lot.,10
Very welcoming host. Charming B&B with a beautiful garden which we could access from our terrace. Our room the Barn also disposed of a small yet fully equipped kitchenette. The airco was also a nice to have given the outside temperatures when we were there! All in all we immediately felt welcome had a great stay and are looking forward to be back.  ,9.6
This is a truely great place to stay. Splendid house superb bed and very friendly landlady. Kids already beg to return. Nothing.,10
Everything was super the best place between Leuven and Bxl. Thanks for all! -,10
Very nice place & friendly people  you feeling in side your house ,10
Cleanliness spacious and very kind host ,9
Den Engel is located in a small hamlet not far from Zaventem airport. The hamlet has a bank and a decent sized supermarket.   The accommodation was very good and the lady in charge was well organised.   Our accommodation was in what appeared to be a stables block of a 120 year old house. The kitchen bathroom and lounge were on the ground floor and the bedroom and another toilet on the upper mezzanine floor. Upstairs was reached via a spiral staircase. The Internet worked OK and there were lots of channels on the TV. Depending on which way the wind is blowing you will hear aircraft if you sit in the garden.  But the apartment walls are very thick and you could not hear anything once inside. ,9.2
Nice  room with air conditioning  Good hospitality ,10
The attention to detail and the warmth of our hosts made for a joyous stay.  Telling everyone I know about Den Engle! Our stay was too short,10
Beautiful setting in a beautiful apartment in honor of the famous cyclist Eddy Merckx. Theme apartment. All nicely decorated!!! All fine!!!,10
Absolute beautiful and relaxing guesthouse. Had everything I could possibly think of. Highly recommended. Thank you very much for my stay. I will be staying with you next time for sure. ,10
The welcome was so warm and kind. The place is cosy and they do everything to make you feel at home. Yasmine and her mother are really nice. The breakfast was amazing and the beds really confortable. Also the area is so quiet and had a good night rest. Perfect for a romantic weekend! None,10
Nice and quit location where you can relax after a workday  ,10
The lady of the house was lovely and welcoming she made me feel at home. Breakfast was extensive and generous. ,10
Warm welcome comfortable bed lovely room house is gorgeous no more to say everything was exactly right no negatives to report,10
Everything was perfect. Beautiful B&B Kindness of the owner nothing,9.6
An excellent place to stay if you are looking for a peaceful rest in the country side. Property is done with taste well maintained impeccably clean and hosts are incredibly kind and forthcoming. Our stay with a little baby was made very comfortable with a cot and high chair for the little one. We had a triple room with amazing bath and sauna. Breakfast is home made and fresh with wide variety of pastries meat cheese and much more for every taste. We will definitely come back when the open-air swimming pool is open in summer. Well done! Everything was perfect!,10
Amazingly friendly family in a gorgeous historic house that has been renovated to have modern roomsSuper breakfast ,10
amazing apartment with very lovely hosts. cosy rooms and the pool in the garden was perfect for the hot days. Breakfast was served in the garden and city centre is 3min walking distance ,9.6
We did like the excellent hospitality and the facilities in particular the sauna. We also had a great breakfast in the garden. As a bonus there were two cute cats including an old lady of 17 years . ,10
Friendly greeting. properties facilities . and great location . ,10
Excellent breakfast. Perhaps misses an oven but not very important.,9
Nice room and bathroom excellent extras like sauna and swimming pool. Very good breakfast. Very good location close to city centre walking distance. Friendly owners Nothing,9.6
Very helpful and friendly hosts. Delicious breakfast! Close to city center. ,9
We thought about keeping this a secret since we definitely want to come back but we felt we owe it to the great hosts: This place is simply amazing! The rooms the breakfast the pool the location..everything! ,10
We thought our host was the best host weve ever encountered in our many years of travelling. Lynn went above and beyond any expectations of a host in such a beautiful guest house. This was five star excellence at its best. Attention to detail is an understatement. We felt like a member of the family. And we will 100% return! Love from Mr & Mrs Buckley Dublin x ,10
Great Breakfast. Lots of character. Very central location with lots of character Was a little hot but I guess it was cold outside !,9.6
Exceptionally beautiful property a fabulous location and such a welcoming friendly and attentive host. We thoroughly enjoyed the Canal View. Couldnt ask for more and wouldnt wish to stay anywhere else. Nothing,10
We were looking forward to staying at this B&B and our expectations were exceeded. Great location perfect accommodation while in Bruges. A lovely Breakfast while overlooking the canal with ducks swimming by . Beautiful service with attentive and friendly hosts.Great restaurants close by and good recommendations on places to eat and on engaging with Bruges. Highly recommended!! I would have liked to stay longermaybe next time,10
The staff were very friendly. The food was fantastic. The rooms were comfy and clean. ,10
Everything was beautiful the view of the canal was awesome and Lynn was an awesome host!  She was so helpful and the  staff making awesome breakfast was great!!  I would go back there again. I highly recommend this property. Coffee available anytime in the living room. nothing really. I would have preferred a late checkout but I understand rooms were needed for the next guests. I did not have hot water but once I told Lynn she took care of it immediately!!,10
Everything the host was amazing all the added little touches made for a perfect stay. Room was fantastic especially the jacuzzi bath. The B & B is absolutely beautiful looks like something out if a fairytale. Is quite central is a short walk to main places :)  N/a,10
Great location and building. Friendly helpful owner ,9
This was our second stay at the Bonifacius and it did not disappoint.  Wonderful in everyway. Location is the best breakfast delightful and extremely comfortable and spacious rooms.  Cant wait to go back. ,10
Beautiful house and amazing attention to details like the fine crockery and glassware It got a bit hot but we turned down the heating and opened the windows!,10
The unexpected little details were greatly appreciated such as the Champagne and Belgian chocolates offered at breakfast. Lynne was a great host and the fact that drinks were available any time of day. ,10
Lin was the best host. We were blown away by her attentiveness and kindness. She was so helpful from the point of arrival through our departure. Breakfast was delicious the location was fabulous and we felt very comfortable and safe.  The hospitality was the highlight. Lin and her staff were absolutely wonderful! The only piece of negative feedback we had was that it was a little noisy at night. The AC rattled when running but it was too hot not to run the AC (this kept us up) and the walls are quite thin so we were woken up by a guest arriving next door.,9.2
. we immediately felt welcome and the host was really taking care of us . very good breakfast and mini-bar included in the price . excellent location in the center and very charming house . highly recommended ,9
Amazing stay at this very beautiful special and romantic guesthouse. Lynn was a very charming helpful and kind host. The room was really lovely and the location very central . The breakfasts were truly amazing such fabulous food service and setting . Wonderful hospitality memorable for all the right reasons! Fantastic thank you so much . Absolutely nothing,10
Fabulous location right in the centre on a canal yet very quiet at night. Exceptional personal service from the owner Lynne. Atmospheric historical setting accommodation and a fine breakfast that would be hard to beat in any larger hotel. If you like staying in something more genuine than a regular hotel (of which there are many fine examples in Bruges) this guesthouse should be on your list for consideration. Nothing really hence excellent scoring. Only quibble was the king-size bed was oddly provided with two single duvets under a counter pane rather than a large king-sized duvet. Both duvets were poorly filled.,10
lyn is a wonderful host extremely well informed and eager to help! ,9.2
Great Stay accommodation was fantastic in a great location right in the centre of town. The host could not do enough to make you feel welcome. Superb breakfast and attentive service Nothing,10
Absolutely fantastic location in short walk distance from most prominent sites with  friendly and helpful staff. Lovely breakfast in cozy room with fantastic view on channel with Swans and open fire place. All was just fine,10
Comfortable bed hearty and delicious breakfast and great hospitality. Suggest that yogurt be offered at breakfast as alternative to eggs.  Wonderful food and host.  Superb location.,10
Stunning guesthouse right in the centre of Bruges. The hospitality was absolutely outstanding and a special mention for the breakfast! ,10
This B&B is so charming! I loved its central location. The breakfast was outstanding and such a treat since it was included in our package. Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Brugge. We wouldnt think of staying anywhere else if we get to visit again! ,10
Very nice private owned small B&B close to the city centre. Lovely owners and staff 1000 times better than a unpersonal hotelchain. ,9.6
What a cozy place its like youre in the city garden. Bed is great view of the garden excellent. Food is even better as is the welcome breakfast and check out. If we ever return to Gent Faja Lobi is our place to stay. The stairs are small so with luggage (of two weeks) its cramped. We had no idea it wasnt allowed to park in the street for more than two hours but with the excellent help of the owner we parked only a block away.,9.6
Staff breakfast Tram nearby garden veranda. please for senior customers provide stronger light bulbs !!,8.3
Good location and lovely shabby chic room The stairs were very narrow and steep.,9.2
Quiet location but close to the city centre. All the sights were within walking distance. The staff were very helpful with giving information and maps and it made the whole experience very easy. ,9.2
Very nice place and the guys so friendly Cannot pay with card,9.6
Large room and big bathroom. Beautiful decorated room albeit a bit quirky. Host is conservationist so will plant a tree in Amazon for every guest. Breakfast quite good but slightly limited choice. All very relaxed and we enjoyed our stay. It is 15 -20 minutes walk into centre of town.  Nothing.,9.2
The room was lovely and very comfortable. Room very spacious and has lots of natural light. Room was supplied with hair dryer and kettle which was very thoughtful for ladies. Breakfast was very nice too. Its more than just a normal continental breakfast.  You have hot bread/croissant fruits all sorts of jams cereals fried egg with bacon yogurt juice etc. Would recommend to stay. The B&B is a bit far from the main train stations and its about 15 mins walk to the closest tram station. Room on third floor but stairs only.,8.8
Very nice odd but in an OK way. Nice garden. Good location Separation of bathroom from bedroom,8.8
The B&B is located in a quiet and nice neighbourhood ~15minutes walk from the city center. There is a nice inner garden where you can chill and/or smoke. The staff are great they were very helpful and talkative. They dont take credit cards.,9.2
Accommodation of real charm and character in a quiet neighbourhood on the edge of the city centre about 15-20 minutes walk from the cathedral. Excellent breakfast provided by the owner Jirgen who made us very welcome and was happy to answer questions about his ecological project in the Congo. There is also a pleasant garden with chairs and tables where guests can relax have a glass of wine etc. The parking area was a couple of streets away. However it was very good value at 5 euros a night.,9.6
Our hostess was very friendly! She told us everything about the city and also she treat us very well! The place is also very cozy and they offer you a good breakfast! There are two faja lobi places in the town only one of them is in the center. Make sure that you have the right address. Also I recomend that you go to this place if you have a chip and can make phone calls because the person that receive you sometimes needs to be called so they can open the door for you. It is not so close from the city center but it is a nice walking.,8
The breakfast the bathroom the concierge service lady  ,8
Really large room with big bed well decorated with good breakfast Bathroom was private rather than en-suitebut it was next door.,9
Quirky old world style room with period furnishings. Very comfy bed.Tea making facilities in the room and an honesty bar downstairs in the kitchen.Breakfast was great with a bacon and eggs option cooked to order. Plenty of croissants bread cheese and meats. Coffee was excellent. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Easy walking distance into Ghent.I would definitely stay again. Bathroom toilet had a dodgy flush button and ran constantly. As I had a separate bathroom this wasnt a big problem though.A reminder it was a cash only payment when booking in would have been appreciated I had to pop into town to a cash point luckily i had left plenty of time to get to my ferry crossing!,9.6
Maya is a very welcoming hostess and provided a great deal of local information which to make our stay more interesting than it would have been otherwise. Very good breakfast - the best on our trip to Belgium. A lot of mosquitoes in the bedroom. We had a top room which was good in terms of quietness and was spacious however with the need to have the windows open near to the tree foliage mosquitoes come in. Internet is not good. We needed to have the room door open to get any signal and this was variable probably due to the number of other guests using it at the same time.,7.9
Liked that our stay meant a tree was planted in the Congo More directions as to get there from a station,8
Unique building with friendly staff and a delicious breakfast It would have been nice to have a TV in the room especially since everything in Ghent closes so early,9.6
Super comforfortable bed..great washroom facility (loved the shower)..wonderful breakfast and superb hosts No TV,9.2
Friendly and helpful staff Nice design Rich Garden Good Breakfast Wifi Lack ot Toilet door in the attic,8
We really liked the accomodiation. The breakfeast was good and the service too. We thought that in the summer it would be a little bit annoying and warm in the room because it is not possible to open the window because of the bees in the garden. It is also a little bit noisy in the houese since the door of the entrance of the house is stucking and we woke up because our room was in the first floor towards the entrance.,9.6
Being able to have a bath. Not having a shower option. There is a hand shower in bath.,7.9
Travelled to Ypres with my 19 yr old son to experience the War graves Menin Gate last post & the general surroundings.  B&B Fresco was a great choice & perfect for what we wanted. Nothing it was a great place,9.6
Erik and his wife were the perfect hosts. Very welcoming making our visit home from home. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was very filling with a great choice. Erik happily adjusted my breakfast as I am vegetarian. ,10
The friendliness of the hosts willingly answered all our questions about the area and made good suggestions.  Excellent breakfast and parking on site.  Enjoyed sitting on the outdoor deck adjacent to the room. We would have appreciated brighter lights in the bedroom for our old eyes to make reading easier.,9.6
The breakfast that Erick served every morning was tasty and there was plenty of it. Nothing really I found everything fine.,8.8
Very comfortable bed Eric is very hospitable A lot of effort taken with breakfast Information suggested there was a washing machine. This was not the case. We were able however to go to a laundromat about a km away which worked well,9.6
Friendly hosts very clean very comfortable and good location. ,10
Great hosts good quality top class facilities  and Wow  the breakfast fantastic. Deffintly will use it again. Nothing to not like,9.6
Eric the owner was amazing and supplied a very hearty breakfast. A perfectly clean and well situated B&B to see the battlefields and Ypres. Nothing there to not like.,10
Warm welcome very helpful host Erik. Also spacious accommodation. Really exceptional breakfast freshly prepared orange juice plus local cheese and ham no cost cutting as some places do. A real pleasure to stay.  Not applicable,10
Eric & Rosita are wonderful hosts helpful and friendly.  Breakfasts very good. There is a shared kitchen with a fridge & microwave handy if needed. The B&B is in a lovely quiet street ( very safe)about a 20 minute walk into the centre of Ypres if one doesnt wish to drive ,10
Friendly clean spacious comfortable great breakfast. If you take the two rooms you have the whole apartment to yourself. Great for friends or a family travelling together  There was nothing we didnt liked.,9.6
Erik and Rosita were fantastic hosts and very nice people. Great accommodation with a very comfy bed. Amazing breakfast with everything fresh - fresh fruit fresh orange juice fresh selection of bread and pastries with ham and cheese. We cycled the 30 mile Peace Route and there was no need for lunch after such a massive breakfast! You would be crazy not to book this B&B! ,10
The place is a gem. Erik and his wife Rosita are so helpful and friendly and the place is spotless. I have never had a breakfast to rival the one offered by these two people. The accomodation is very comfortable and positively brimming with quality. I would recommend B & B Fresco to anyone. Pet friendly and so well positioned for Ypres centre-it could hardly be rivalled! We will be going back! Thank you!  ,10
Every thingroom breakfast and host superband great we put our motorcycle in garage Nothing,10
Erik was a marvellous host with tips and info in addition to an exceptional breakfast.  The b&b had those lovely additional items like fluffy dressing gowns. ,10
Home from home  friendly and excellent hosts was able to put motorcycle in garage  ,7.9
Friendly owners. Lovely breakfasts and clean accommodation.  I came here 3 years ago with my cycling buddies and my wife and I stayed for 3 nights this time. Highly recommended and near to ypres centre as well as main roads. Couldnt find fault.,10
The owners were very welcoming. The walk into town was enjoyable  The breakfast was very filling.  The accommodation as a whole was very comfortable ,10
Extra comfy bed and pillows. Attention to detail in everything.  Welcoming and informative hosts. Especially lovely breakfast which was enough for us to make rolls for lunch. Close enough to town to walk. Use of top floor including lounge and dining space and bedroom had UK TV! Nothing,10
Love love loved our hosts Eric and Rosita. They made our stay wonderful. Breakfast was amazing and we had great conversation with the two of them. Would recommend their place to any/everyone interest in visiting Ypres! ,10
beautiful place! full of amazing climate! wonderful views from the window. very clean and homey. the hosts very helpful! Thank you very much and we will visit you again with pleasure ,10
The owners were very friendly and helpfull. The room was very nice and clean. The breakfast had every thing we needed and was fresh.The serounding  is quiet en relaxing.

Super quiet Beautiful room Super comfy Amazing breakfast  Wish to stay more longer,10
Very peaceful location and accomodations. ,9
I can recommend this B&B 100 %Beside the wonderful rennovated house nature Tasty breakfast Babs and her Team are great !! ,9.6
Everything was perfect And .. super breakfast . In those Covid times its rare enough to be said Host was super nice and kind Definitely the place to be in this area  ,10
Quiet location but also close to must see cities in Flanders. We enjoyed the breakfast very much! The owners were also very friendly and kind. Private shower but shared toilet. Private toilet would be more comfortable.,9.6
Owner was very very friendly and breakfast was delicious.   The house was decorated beautifully and the garden was beautiful. Nothing much,8.8
The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was very tasty.the host was very friendly ,9
Maria is a great hostess. Only thing there is not private bathroom. Its not clear when you book it. Not a big deal but I like my private bathroom.,9.6
The B&B is located in a very nice and picturesque part of the town next to the park and the city center is only 10 minutes walk. The breakfast was home made and delicious plus everything was clean and tidy. Maria will be a wonderful host ! ,10
Great location walkable from the station and within walking of all the beautifully scenic areas of Bruges. Maria is a quirky and charming host and we enjoyed getting to know her even if our stay was very brief. She also went out of her way to help us on our last day which we greatly appreciate!  ,9.2
Location and host Unfortunately there were roadworks nearby at the time of visit which made access a pain (not the fault of the hostclearly),9.2
Everything! It was a wonderful experience and Maria was a lovely host. The breakfast was always on time and the house always absolutely spotless. Her english was also very good and she helped us massively by providing a map of Brugge and everything good to do in the area when we arrived! 10/10 would recommend Being extremely picky - the shower wasnt a typical shower you had to sit in the bath and sort of hose yourself off. Would have been nice to have a proper stand-up shower but I guess its all part of the experience so no complaints here!,10
 Maria is super nice and always tries her best to help me:) the room is super clean and beautiful,10
The host Maria was a wonderful host and quite a character.  She gave us all the information we needed for our stay in Bruges.  She cooked us an exceptional omelet every morning along with fresh bread and homemade jam salami cheese and the best coffee.  Her price was a very good price the location was great and she offered us a {costs extra} garage for our car which was a big plus.  We would stay there again for sure. ,10
Very good localisation and very noce owner ,10
Maria was amazing! great value for money great location- really close to centre of Bruge. Was surprised to find the parking space was a garage which made me feel that my car was safe. Will definitely stay again. Thank you Maria  ,10
Quiet and convenient location Great welcome with map and directions Not enough orange juice for everyone at breakfast  Too much conversation not understood to other Belgian quests at breakfast,7.9
Near the center of the city and near the railway station The host lives in that house,9
Maria is a very nice Host. Nice place to stay for a night on Brugge. ,8.8
Easy walking access through a park to the main attractions in Bruges. If you get there by car there is a possibility to have a covered and secured parking spot for 10 euro/day. Breakfast is generous with a signature home made omelette and jam. Host is a long time traveler and has plenty of interesting stories to share. ,9
Maria is a great host. The house is beautiful near to the center and our room was cozy. She made us a delicious breakfast and she bring us information to visit the Town. This is an amazing place fully recommended.  ,10
It was cosy and homely Maria made us all very welcome lovely lady with lots of good advice It could really do with tea and coffee facilities in the room so u could make your own hot drinks,10
Maree was a very welcoming hostess the property was spotlessly clean and the breakfast was 1st class. Nothing,10
Maria is a lovely woman with a heart of gold. The room is magnificent and the bathroom and toilet are very clean. We enjoyed the delicious self-made breakfast! Thank you! ,10
The hospitality of the host Was just astonishing. Did not expect such a warm approach. She gave all the instructions and recommendations were to go that was very helpfull. The check out flexibility was convenient as well. Highly recommended ,10
Nicely positioned B&B with a very accommodating host.  It was a flying visit so we did not have enough time to truly appreciate the Brugge experience. No internet.,8.3
Amazing breakfast very clean rooms and nice staff. ,8
The breakfast was very nice full of varieties of food to eat to full you up throughout the day  it was amazing The jacuzzi was not on,10
The location was very nice and peaceful perfect Going home,10
Beautiful setting quite and rural.  Safe parking.  Lovely owners.  Breakfast was great.  Would use again. ,7.5
It was simple and functional. Everything you needed with really friendly staff and a good breakfast. I would use again. A bit unromantic so I wouldnt stop there with my wife and son on a trip but for single person use its fine.,8.8
Nice place to stay quiet comfortable room.  A great breakfast kind hosts - we had a nice chat. ,9.2
excellent breakfast quiet place and very pleasant environment room very clean staff very available ,9
Made welcome and comfortable - Marie Louise and Hugo could not have been more helpful it enhanced my experience immensely No grumbles at allb,10
We went to the Truck Grand Prix in Zolder. The race track can be reached on foot in half an hour. It is not a luxury hotel that we did not expect and did not book. But it is a very good family-run country hotel. The friendliness of the owners and the cleanliness should be emphasized. There are free parking spaces available and the owner takes you directly to the race track with a small bus free of charge. Thanks a lot and keep it up! The pillows could have been a little softer.,9.2
Nice and helpful owners really delicious breakfast the room was simple but comfortable. I have nice time there :) ,8.8
Easy safe parking comfortable room air con fridge coffee always available brilliant breakfast relaxing hot tub attentive hosts beautiful setting close to Circuit Zolder Not applicable.. everything was great thank you,10
Very nice quiet location close to Hasselt where I was for business.  The rooms were cleaned daily nothing to complain.  The breakfast was one of the most extensive Ive seen for a long time even the bread was coocked fresh every morning. ,9.6
Good breakfast with lots of choices. Great coffee. ,8
Our rooms were clean with table and chairs a settee plus bunk beds. Ensuite with shower. Beautiful gardens with some amazing plants and seating areas. And a Donkey !! We were greeted by our host Marie Louise and given a list of places to eat nearby and she offered us bikes to get there as we had a problem with the car. We had a fantastic breakfast lots of choice. Tea and coffee available all day and evening in the breakfast area. Unfortunately it was only an overnight stay. I would have been very happy to stay longer. Our son and daughter-in-law were given a discount too on arrival as our Grandson was so young. Would have liked to explore the area but we didnt have time. Would highly recommend. Thank you for a lovely stay. ,10
Great location. Great price. Great staff. Everything was ok,10
Great breakfast. Easy to find just about 5km from the freeway. Good wifi. Helpful host. No problems.,9.2
Last visit we were delayed and very late but they stayed-up so that we could get-in despite it being so late - no words of acrimony. Very accommodating. Drinks in the fridge available on the honour system - it is so nice to be trusted! Id wanted to stay overnight a couple of months ago but they were full - not at all surprising! I look forward  to staying there again in future. something like tomatoes gherkins or cucumber to go with the breakfast would be nice - the meat and cheese whilst nice were dry to eat.,10
Very pleasant experience! The hosts were really nice and friendly and the breakfast was excellent! ,10
Quiet location. Single room with enough space. Breakfast was ok. The rooms are noisy. The TV from the room next door was easy to hear.,8
Shower room was very nice and breakfast was awesome. ,9.6
Friendly staff clean and tidy delicicous breakfast with Belgium chocolade as piece de resistance.Safe and spacious private parking & lots of closets and good showers staff welcomed group arriving with motorcycles ---> biker friendly location. ,9.6
Fantastic b&b. Couldnt be more friendly or helpful. Would def go back and will recommend to friends ,10
The hostess is wonderful kind and nice very attentive too. ,10
We booked this B&B for the festival Antilliaanse feesten. This location was a full halfhour drive to the festival back and forth. So one might want to overthink this distance to the festival for 3 days. Bit overall a fantastic place to stay. Rooms were superclean the staff overly friendly and very helpful. The view from the room was a bit poor due to the fact that we overlooked gardens of residences next door. The view from the room overlooking gardens of children playing and no privacy when door was open.,9.2
Spacious room with all necessary facilities. Hilde is a fantastic host. ,9.6
Hilde was an amazingly kind and thoughtful host. The breakfast was delicious and it was even served earlier just for us - thank you! ,9.2
Beautifully appointed B&B with friendly owners. There was a problem with the WiFi (which had been excellent) and the owners imediately acted.I used it as a base to go to Tournhout Vorselaar Geel and Mechelen all of which were in easy driving distance.Highly recommended. ,9.6
Great place to stay on business well signed from main road from every direction good parking comfortable rooms and great breakfast everything you need when you are travelling on business will stay again when I am in the region. ,10
Fantastic people fantastic breakfast. Perfect all around.  ,10
Very comfy bed lovely wash room and very good TV with apps. Lovely area also the owners were fabulous very friendly would stay again. ,10
The Hospitality of Hilde and the materials used in the interior ,10
Amazing house with nice garden. Hilde was  a wonderful host and very helpful to us. She  has a lovely demeanour and we all liked her from the moment we met her. The breakfast was really magnificent! Stayed here a few times and we will return again for sure. ,10
The accommodation was quiet lovely and my little family and I had a very good night sleep. The room was cosy and with all the conviences to make your stay very agreable. The breakfast  had in the morning of the Catholic Easter was perfect and the host suprised us with chocolate egs. We really appreciated the stay in Gierle and we will definetly put the location on our favorites places to visit again. The lack of time to enjoy more the company of the lovely hosts and the surroundings.,10
Wonderful breakfast. Amazing host and such comfortable beds. The bathroom was amazing. Al round amazing stay. ,10
Great location very friendly staff and most of all lovely clean spacious and comfortable place to stay. Perfect and highly recommend! ,10
Excellent breakfast Bed was not super comfirtable - particularly the sofa bed used by our daughter,7.9
Wonderful place in a very nice environment. Our family enjoyed the stay in the B&B Hippodrome very much ,10
Love the Arboretum next door great after-breakfast hikes before heading into the City. ,10
very nice B&B managed like a family business If you have to be in the center of Brussels but you dont have a car its rather inconvenient. But if you have a car and if you like the countryside this is a good place to stay,8.8
very fresh bread good selection local jam ,9
Very friendly professional and flexible staff. Rooms are very clean Rooms are a bit basic but thats in line with the price I paid for my room,10
Breakfast was fresh and copious. Very hospitable staff and the rooms were nice and large. I loved it that each room had its own little patio. The water bottle in the room tasted like its been standing there for a while.,10
The exceptional warm and hospitality of the host family despite Covid-19 challenges was a highlight. The breakfast first class. Not worth mentioning,9
Very friendly hosts and wonderful breakfast ,9
Quirky rooms great breakfast Bed was very high so high in fact there were steps up to it! Also it was against the wall so would not be very practical for a couple who need to get up in the night.,8.3
Cosy farm house. Completely renovated cottages. Excellent breakfast. If you like cheese and fresh special bread this is a great place.  ,9.2
The hosts were kind and amazingly helpful. Breakfast and dinner were incredible extremely generous. The place in itself is cute and very well located. A hidden gem that well visit again I dont have a bad thing to say about this place,10
Breakfast is spectacular.  The owners are friendly and very helpful. The surroundings are perfect: the canal is beautiful and the fields are such a restful environment. The quality of the bed could have been better and although sufficient the bathroom facilities need some help too.,9.2
The buffet breakfast was excellent. The hosts were very helpful relaxed and efficient. Our room was large and comfortable. A good point for visits to Bruges the coast and Holland (Sluis was lovely) Wi-Fi was only available in the breakfast room. A longish walk to Damme.,9.5
Unlike most B&Bs it has an equiped kitchen. Room is a bit dull. Some wall decorations or a plant would make the room more enjoyable.,8
Lovely B&B with excel.lent owner. All was very tidy and clean. ,10
I really loved the accommodation. The lady who runs the place is very friendly. The rooms are in an old farm which has been renovated with much taste. The breakfast was very good. Although not far away from a rather busy street the house is in a quite neighbourhood where you can sleep with an open window and in the morning enjoy the birds singing. ,9.6
Super friendly and flexible hostBrand new studio clean and spaciousHuge breakfast!! ,10
Breakfast was super and more then enough. Super friendly host and very flexible. The B&B also had a very good parkinglot easily accesible. nothing,9
It was new cozy and the owner was a nice person.  The breakfast was amazing. Very good value!  ,9.6
Private parking area pretty much brand new building modern but cozy and warm tastefully decorated very friendly owner. ,10
Lovely location and room.  Breakfast was wonderful. Extremely friendly hosts. Not applicable,10
what a welcome what a nice atmospere great rooms great facilities overly warm and nice people ,10
Outstanding breakfast lovely people. Leaving!,10
The way in which this former farmhouse has been turned into a beautiful B&B is impressive. The family room was very big including a large bathroom. The eye for detail in the tasteful decoration in the house can be seen everywhere. You just feel the warmth and love of the owners for the place and for the guests. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the best part was the friendly and hartwarming conversation with the owners during breakfast. The B&B is located in a peaceful small village but close to the highway for easy connection by car to many places in Belgium. The price/quality was excellent! Would love to return in winter time to enjoy the cosy looking living room and read a book by the fireplace after a walk. Nothing to dislike,9.6
Great location close to motorway but nestled in countryside and quiet. Large family room with separate room for children and spacious bathroom. Super friendly hosts and wonderful breakfast. Perfect stopover on our journey from London to Austria. ,10
Beautifully converted barn adjoining main farm house with enclosed courtyard. Reception area was full of interesting collectables. In fact the whole of the B&B was! All tasteful and rural with a touch of the french country house. ,10
Just the most welcoming of any B&B we immediately felt like we were staying with good friends..peaceful beautifully decorated and extra large rooms and bathrooms. We only wish we could have stayed longer in this small Belgian village. Breakfast in the courtyard was fantastic with homemade jams and yogurt. we will definitely be going back to this little corner of Belgium. nothing!! All fabulous and very highly recommended!,10
Very nice room clean silent simply perfect. Very good breakfast buffet. ,10
The owners are super kind and helpful! Breakfast very good and tasty! And if you need to be up super early to head to the forest for morning photography you can either arrange for Karin to make a breakfast (or take away sandwiches) waiting for you in the fridge or make breakfast on your own. This I liked a lot! ,9.6
Very friendly very comfortable very tasty ,10
Great location-few mins away from the station and the center. Very cozy and comfortable and nice interior! Breakfast is excellent and the host is extremely! Would love to visit once the lockdown is over and try the homemade jam for breakfast :) ,10
Bang opposite the station though there is a canal in the way of the direct route - allow 6 minutes.  For those who dont know it Halle is a great alternative to staying in Brussels - five trains an hour taking 10-15 minutes and a decent little town.  Les Eleveurs is a superb restaurant and there are numerous decent bars in the centre.  Excellent homey breakfast. Getting in was a bit hit and miss.,8.8
Convenient  clean comfortable and a superb breakfast  Everything was lovely,10
The B&B is located centrally in Halle where I was working its close to the shops and restaurants and just across the canal from the train station where you can get trains into central Brussels (15min) and airport (45min). Karin is a wonderful host the breakfasts are delicious and my room was very clean and comfortable. The B&B only has 5 rooms so there is a nice cosy atmosphere.  Nothing,10
Very friendly welcoming proprietors who warmly welcomed us even after arriving late. Made us a dinner reservation at a nearby restaurant. Facility and breakfast was excellent. ,9.6
Superb 3 night stay in this fabulous brand new ultra modern house.the hosts alain and bea were amazingly friendly.nothing was too much trouble and a joy to stay with.breakfast was excellentwith fresh home baked fruit tart on our last morning and eggs from their own hens.it was very quiet with stunning views from our balcony.we would highly recommend and will certainly be going back. Nothing whatsoeverit was magnificent.,10
Everything! nothing we didnt like. Could not of asked for a better place to stay for our two days having just been in Germany and we were making our way back to the UK.,10
Breakfast was excellent. Alin and Beatrice were fabulous! ,10
The whole experience was superb. Beau and Alin were welcoming friendly and really helpful - a real pleasure to talk too. The location is beautiful and the room was spacious and the bed was comfy. I loved the special touches on the bed and the sweets!  We.would definitely go back. Highly recommended For us It was ideal,8
The hosts were so welcoming and helpful they have a wonderful modern home. Breakfast was super and the village is ideally placed for either cycling the local Forrest area or visiting Bastogne  ,10
Everything was wonderful from the owners to the rooms to breakfast. We plan to return! Its a bit of a drive from Bastogne but worth the effort.,9.6
Confortable and cozy room nice host and very nice breakfast brought to our room at the agreed time. Ten minutes away from the center of Ieper. ,10
Loved the way it was presented all food was lovely and fresh Nothing,10
Every thing absolutely first class breakfast was absolutely lovely fresh and plentiful fresh eggs from Hens in garden.(Which by the way you can not hear.) ,10
good location easy to findbreakfast was excellent delivered on time to the door in basket.Lovely clean room nicely furnishedevery thing about place was good 10/10. Nothing to dislike,10
The property was lovely.  Very well located about a 10 minute walk from the Menin Gate.  The owners were so nice and very helpful (even let me borrow hair straighteners as I forgot UK/EU adaptor so couldnt use mine). Breakfast was great delivered outside the room at a time of our choosing and we could eat inside our private room or outside on the most beautiful terrace/garden.  All excellent. ,10
Good location breakfast was nice pascaline and Mark were lovely hosts nothing was to much trouble and the cat was also friendly Nothing not to like a great all round stay,10
Breakfast was excellent.  Plenty to eat. All good Didnt stay long enough.,10
Beautiful place We had the best stay here and the service is over the top A real home away from home. Best room best breakfast and the nicest people running this place. For sure we will return here. ,10
Very charming and delicious breakfast. Super friendly owners. ,10
I very much liked and appreciated the warmth of the place and hosts. The breakfasts couldnt be better. Easy parking. ,9.6
Very good value for money. Very good breakfast. It is worth a 5 stars hotel.  Kindness of the hosts. Ideally situated between Gent and Antwerp. We visited Gent on day and Antwerp the other one. This was a very good option for us instead of staying in expensive hotel in the middle of the city. ,10
Fabulous house and a very warm welcome from Erwin and Luuk who were keen to share their enthusiasm for the conversion and their new B & B venture.  Breakfast was lovely and beautifully presented. ,10
Breakfast was amazing room very comfortable and spotlessly clean. If anything the lack of shower gel.,9.6
Marvelous place two steps from the center of Hamme with an inner terrace where you can relax and take a drink. The building is incredibly renovated with attention to the smallest details. But the atmosphere the warmth is incomparable from the rooms but for most from the two owners who care for guests as if you were long time friends. ,10
Very nice and overwhelming breakfast quiet environment superb view nice walks into the woods nice host everything very clean. Some nice restaurants at approx 10 to 15 km. ,8
Nice room nice bathroom the owner is very friendly and makes you feel at home.  Mi casa es su casa.  Breakfast with a large variety of cheeses meats preserves .. and when the sun shines breakfast is served outside on the terrace (unfortunately when we were there weather was not so good). Environment is great for hiking the owner showed us a very nice one which we did. We had quite some flies in the room but that will get solved soon as the owner will put screens on all opening windows so that will be solved fast.,9.2
Everything. From arrival to departure. Great host warm welcome nice rooms COVID-proof fantastic diner & breakfast wonderful environment.  ,10
We were received very warmly by the owners they are very friendly and attentive to customers the accommodation was very pleasant and we felt comfortable that place is beautiful we will definitely return. ,10
The place is a absolute delight! High quality decoration and extra clean. Hilde the host is excellent. She goes above and beyond taking care of the guests. Breakfast is amazing. The surroundings are safe and beautiful. Fabulous gataway in the heart of the Ardennes. ,10
Amazing location in the green. Perfect for couples and families. Super nice owners Nothing,10
Ms Hilde was very kind and welcoming and the house is decorated in impeccable style. The breakfast is fresh and home-made and the rooms are very cosy and warm. La Gotale is also easily accessible by car and close to many beautiful villages in the area. The ideal place to have a relaxing weekend. ,10
The breakfast was great! Hilde made it really tasty! If there was something you could ask her anything. The rooms and the bathroom were beautiful even the kitchen the living room..a very charming house. I totally loved it! The view was great we were lucky that it just snowed. There is also parking nothing negative to say!  Great stay! I would recommend it to everyone :)  Groetjes Annelies & Anthony Nothing!,10
Very good hotel located in quiet area perfect to rest. Breakfast was good. Kitchen where you can grab everything you need and big living room downstairs for everyone are making it feel like home. The hotel host is always friendly and ready to help with anything. Everything was good but i think with current facilities the price for a room was a bit too high.,9.6
Hildy was an excellent host. Very friendly and did the most amazing breakfasts for us! The room was really clean and comfortable and the bathroom was large with a very good shower. It was quite warm when we were there so a fan in the room would have been nice and the pillows were very squishy which is not my taste (this is personal though others may prefer this) however these are minor issues and didnt detract from the fact we had a brilliant stay here.,9
It is a perfect location with a great view on the landscape.  Very good meals in the evening and excellent breakfast. The hostess is very friendly and makes time to talk with you. wifi can be better.  But for the rest everything ok !,10
We enjoyed the stay at La-Gotale the pleasant hospitality of Hilda the beautiful landscape around the huge house which designed perfectly by Hilda (Charming and also an Architect) the tasty and colored breakfasts each morning were joyful for all of us especially to the kids which were excited with the brown morning ) The house itself is very comfortable besides our room facilities there is the big living room for all guests with fruits coffee and tea bar. For travelers cycling or walking the location is amazing also for families but if the kids getting hungry after getting back home take under consideration that you will need to drive about 30 minutes to find open restaurant (burgers pizza cafe ice-cream. etc.). ,10
Beautiful boutique B&B. Perfect location for a weekend of walks good food nearby and exploring the area.The breakfast was excellent and the surroundings beautiful. You need to stay here! Nothing bad to say. Only thing is that we didnt have toiletries nor WiFi details in the bedroom.,10
This charming property was better than we could have imagined! Unfortunately we could only stay for one night but wish it was for longer. Thank you Hilde for a delicious breakfast & a lovely stay at your beautifully renovated property. We hope to be back someday! ,10
Everything was perfect. The place the breakfast and especially the host Aline. So worm and friendly person that took care of everything. Amazing stay. ,10
The owners are absolutely delightful we felt very welcome and service was great. Just outside of the city of Diest there is also a lot of beautiful countryside to explore. Nothing as such to report all was catered for - perhaps for an English public add some English Breakfast or Earl Grey teas Freshly made eggs were great at breakfast!,9.6
The place itself high quality to the price and especially the staff who was very kind and friendly ,9.6
What I liked? Well.. This ise easy - EVERYTHING! The hostess was so welcoming that we felt like we stayd in our friends house. There are only 2 rooms and as we were only quests the house was for us. Free cold beers in the friger waiting us after long day on foot.. It was heaven! If we are going back to this area we already know were we stay! ,10
Continental breakfast wonderful furnishing and style of the accommodation. The host is pretty nice and friendly! There wasnt any extra blankets two people get one blanket (otherwise it was comfortable but we like sleeping with separate blankets).,8.8
The owner is so lovely! Ash was very helpful and made us feel at home. The rooms are very clean and very nicely decorated. We loves the old furniture. She made us an excellent breakfast (with high quality regional food). ,10
Very helpful and sympathetic owner.  Marvelous breakfast. Clean and very quiet room. In one word: excellent. ,9.6
A real gem of a place! This B&B is located close to the centr of Ypres just a short walk from the excellent Flanders Fields Museum and Menin Gate as well as close to a range of very good bars and restuarants. The property is very tastefully furnished rooms are spacious and very comfortable and there is a lounge and garden sitting area too our hosts were welcoming and knowledgable about the local area helping us to plan our stay and get the most out of the time we had there. Breakfast was delicious. And in the current Covid time - everything was clean all precautions were followed and local retuarants etc also all appeared to be following proper procedures wiht masks mandatory in the town centre. ,10
Hospitality and service was impeccable.    We look forwards to returning. ,10
Everything was perfect nicest place Ive ever stayed in  ,10
A wonderful historic building in the centre of Ypern with beautifully decorated rooms. Each room has a unique style ours faced the calm courtyard was bright and had a huge bathroom. The owners offered plenty of excellent advice on take away food (due to the pandemic many places were closed) and even prepared a lovely dinner table for us. The breakfast was delicious and all our wishes could be fulfilled. We couldnt have imagined a better place to spend a night and can only recommend it. ,10
Our hosts at B&B La Porte Cochere were charming welcoming and knowledgable about Ypres and the history of the area. ,10
Beautiful house good rooms friendly hosts! ,9
Breakfast great beautiful property staff great love the dog ,9.6
The owners were extremely helpful and courteous and very knowledgeable about the town and its history!  Nothing was too much trouble and unusually for Ypres parking was available and straightforward. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this establishment ,9
My partner and I very much enjoyed the stay. We had such a warm welcome when we enter the door. I am sure you would not miss anything!  ,10
The most gorgeous B&B in the middle of Ypres. Such wonderful helpful & welcoming hosts sharing such insightful info on the history of Ypres. Will return..!  ,10
Welcome from our host beautifully decorated large rooms elegance of the old house. ,10
The hosts are lovely along with the house. Location brilliant lovely big rooms.Great restaurant on the corner nice breakfast  and lots of sockets to charge phones etc All I can think of was the rain on the last day,10
The owners were so welcoming and informative their knowledge on the local area and history was excellent nothing was too much trouble they spoke excellent English and entertained us with local stories and generously shared their local beers on the terrace Nothing not to like,10
This was a lovely B&B in Ypres with welcoming and knowledgeable hosts. Would highly recommend staying here as it is close to everything you want to see in Ypres and the hospitality was first class. ,8.8
Absolutely lovely place and everything was just perfect. Superb breakfast and very welcoming. Will definitely be going back. ,10
Katrien and Steven are kind warm people and go to all ends to make sure you feel more than comfortable. Rooms are cozy and lovely. We loved our weekend in Ieper and our stay the breakfast and the hospitality was truly exceptional. Highly recommend!! Everything was just perfect,10
Exceptional stay - extremely helpful and pleasant hosts seemed nothing was too much trouble.  Wonderful selection for breakfast.  The room was very spacious and clean. I cant think of one thing to dislike!  My only recommendation would be for anyone not able to manage stairs to request a lower level room.,9.6
Extremely friendly hosts there was no need to visit tourist information as Steven provided maps and suggestions of what to see in the time available.  Location is fantastic very close to town square.  Breakfast was actually far more than we could eat.  As the weather was so warm a fridge was stocked with bottled water in the hall.  Lovely terrace to sit out in the evening.  Only possible improvement would be small fridges in the rooms to keep any drinks or food purchased cold.  ,9.2
We were made to feel very welcome. Steven and Catherine were very helpful in suggesting an itinerary and restaurants. The hotel is really well situated in Cantrell Ieper. Although there is no parking with the hotel street parking is very easy - no problem at all. Lovely breakfast. ,9.6
Charming place very comfortable room delicious breakfast and above all kind welcoming and full of local knowledge. Nothing,10
Beautiful historic house so close to Ypres Centre. We had a room on the top floor very spacious and clean with the most wonderful bed! Really lovely welcoming and informative owners who gave us lots of interesting stories and personal family history relating to the area. Plus tips of where to eat drink and visit.  Lounge with TV teas hot chocolate & coffee for residents was a nice touch too. Thoroughly recommended! Nothing - loved it!,10
We loved everything about it -  the decor  bedroom and facilities the breakfast and above all else the welcome we received from Steven and Katrien. We have already recommended it to friends and would definitely stay there again. Nothing,10
Everything. We arrived far too early and the owners were very accommodating. They allowed us to put our luggage in one of the rooms and gave us keys so we were free to return later. Also when we vacated the room they allowed us to leave our luggage to collect later.Lovely breakfast  Katrina and Steven were excellent hosts.Less than five minutes walk to the square. Perfect location. Everything was perfect,10
Fabulous hosts - recommended to all our friends. The best we have stayed at by far :) ,10
Everything exceeded our expectations. The hosts Katrien and Steven are lovely people. We felt so welcome and well taken care of. Would highly recommend! ,10
This B&B was by far the best we have ever stayed in great hosts beautiful house and fantastic location  ,10
The accommodation was superb. Hosts were exceptional. Location perfect. The building is beautiful and beautifully decorated. Our room was spaceous looking out over the garden. Breakfast dining room was delightful and food was delicious. Hosts were so welcoming and more than helpful. We will be back again. ,10
Really lovely property in the heart of Ypres. Parking was easy outside of the B&B. The owners gave us lots of help with sightseeing tips. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. ,10
The reception was very friendly. Good information a nice beer and good company. The Rooms where big clean and very nice. The location is very central and in a beautiful house. The owners are very friendly and know a lot about the history of Ypres and the Ypres Salient on the western front. The breakfast was a a joy in a very beatiful room and the bed was nice. ,10
This property is perfectly located with fantastic hosts - It felt like home :-) The breakfast was lovely and the location for this part of Ypres could not be better Would highly recommend The only thing that I didnt really like was that the Toilet facility in the bedroom itself was not very private The wall didnt meet the Ceiling :-(,9.6
Extremely friendly & interesting hosts that made us feel really most welcome. Very comfortable and spacious accommodation in a convenient but quiet spot in the town. We were traveling home from further afield and decided to break the journey in Ypres so only stayed one night. Could not recommend enough and will return for a longer stay next time.. Thank you! ,10
We visited Ieper to commemorate the 100th anniversary of our grandfathers death in the Great War. Our hosts were very welcoming friendly and  their knowledge of their history was extensive  which we found very helpful as we explored the town  Lovely.house and a great location. Would highly recommend.  ,10
Stephen and Katrien who were perfect hostsGreat breakfast in a wonderfulLocationIn a amazing property ,10
Beautiful period house. Great Hosts.   Very well situated. ,10
Breakfast was amazing. Everything was excellent.,10
Friendly welcome and lots of helpful tips from the owners. Great location just off the main Square. Plentiful continental style breakfast. ,10
Central great hosts beautiful house would go back again. ,10
We truly enjoyed the welcoming and friendly hosts Steven and Katrien. Stevens direct family link as well as the buildings link complete with photos and stories of the rebuilding of the cloth hall the cathedral an Menon Gate  were a unique and much appreciated bonus. All their recommendations were excellent.  The B&B has been wonderfully upgraded and maintained. Breakfast was of course excellent.  Any complaints were only some personal preferences  so not worth mentioning,9.6
Breakfast was superb especially the poached eggs which were worthy of an award!! Stephens home made jams were fab! Followed by a very interesting history lecture explaining the carving of the lions by his grandfather. Nothing that comes to mind except the weather which was a bit unsettled,10
Quality breakfasts. Friendly professional owners. ,10
Everything. Excellent friendly hosts made us feel extremely welcome. Very good location central but quiet. A short walk from the centre/station /menin gate..Fabulous breakfast beautiful home - everything you could wish for in such a memorable city. We love Ieper/Ypres.  Nothing! Everything was excellent,10
A very warm welcome from delightful hosts. Lovely clean well appointed rooms. Delicious breakfast. Fab location for Central Ypres. ,10
The surrounding was nice and everybody was very friendly. I could not sleep at all the first night because of the matrass the owner gave me another room next day. breakfast could be improved. too much plastic. I had a problem with the matrass. It was hot the room was very sticky we had to leave the door to the garden open but because of the pond in the garden there were lots of mosquitos.,5
Beds were perfect guest toom excellent beautiful garden friendly staff ,10
We booked the tiny house next to the lake.  We  were delighted that the terrace overlooked the lake and we had a private access to the lake. Nothing,10
The attention we received and the breakfast. Nothing.,8.8
Very pleased arrived late staff very helpful and accommodating. Breakfast plentiful and delicious. Superb will definately stay again. ,10
The breakfast was very good and the beds are very soft The WiFi wasnt in reach an extra acces point could not hurt..,9
The breakfast and the view from the breakfastplace are great. It is not a buffet but you can take som fruits you want you have a pastry some bread some cereals some breadspread .. The garden is beautiful. And a great shower! ,8.8
The very friendly welcome late in the evening and the the dinner that followed. The latter is not so common in smaller hotels and B&Bs. So I highly appreciated this aspect. Rooms well furbished and very clean. Last but not least a good wine recommendation to go with the food I was served. ,10
Everything was excellent so warm and welcoming we would definitely return if we was back in the area thank you for such a pleasant stay. ,10
The Quality of the service.  The cleanliness the breakfast was exquisite providing a large selection of meats cheese breads home made jams and the presentation was absolutely beautiful. Overall the quality for the money that was paid was excellent. I would have liked to stay a few days more.,10
This place is fantastic! The hosts are so nice and welcoming and both food and room is great! Definitely coming back. ,10
Very friendly hosts!!  Welcome drink !!  Excellent breakfast!! Very clean accommodation!! ,8.8
The hosts were great.  Breakfast spread fantastic  We welcomed the opportunity to have a drink in the outside bar area. ,9.2
The room was immaculate beautifully decorated very comfy bed. Breakfast was amazing so much choice and beautifully presented. The owners were helpful and friendly enjoyed a chat and happy to help with anything. Would definitely recommend it best B&B we have stayed in we will definitely return. Nothing.,10
I thought this was a lovely cosy place full of personal touches and interesting little collections of quirky things..including a working gramophone! Ours hosts/the owners gave us a very warm welcome and were very helpful.. and their beautiful little dog was great too :) Breakfast was great lots of homemade things and very filling. Dont forget to have a game of table football before you leave.. ,10
Le Flaneur is a delightful B&B - it is beautifully kept and displays an eclectic collection of vintage and antique objects. The hosts Erika and Dietrich are warm and welcoming and could not have been more helpful. The  breakfast is outstanding - Erika makes something extra every morning so we had French toast one day and a quiche the next.  We will definitely be returning. ,10
Fabulous place perfect location amazing breakfast the hosts were really friendly they couldnt do enough for you very helpful and made us feel so welcomed thank you. I would highly recommend to stay here. Thanks again we had a great time :) Nothing,10
Every morning the hosts had a new creation for breakfast (sometimes something sweet then something with eggs etc.). This made the breakfast very tasty and special. Furthermore the hosts were super friendly and helpful. We had a cozy room under the roof and felt super comfortable. Straight recommendation! ,10
the godly breakfast!!! The magnificent room!!! The location!!! ,10
Wonderfull breakfast nice hosts early check-in. Everything worked as it should just recommended. ,9.6
We had a pleasant stay in this charming real Brugge-spirit B&B! Its located in an old typical house just outside the busy city center calm and nice neighbourhood. We liked a lot the hospitality of the owners (including the cutest doggy who loves to play and a cat). The breakfast was really good! Fresh juice good quality local bread rolls (pistolet) warm eggs salmon (I dont like meat so really appreciate that) a homemade delicious dessert etc! Yes you have to eat it in a room (covid.) but its more than enough!  As its a typical old house to keep in mind that its not entirely soundproof including a toilet in a room however we had no problem with that at all! ,10
Wonderful home cooked breakfasts with a different dish everyday and a very sweet little pet dog. Owners were very accommodating. ,9
Excellent breakfast with eggs prepared in different ways every morning fresh juice and other delicious things to make your morning better. The hosts were really friendly and nice. The location is very close to the city centre. The rooms facilities were not so practical: from a too small toilet separate from the lavatory to a sink with two faucets that proved to be complicated to use. The sheets were not impecably clean.,7.1
The rooms the hosts and the little host dog were all very charming. Located in a quiet street on walking distance from the Markt. Possibility to book the sauna on colder days. The breakfast was especially nice and every day the hosts cooked up something special like delicious rhubarb crumble or french toast.  ,10
The owners are so lovely and friendly. They made us feel so welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfasts were wonderful! Our was large clean and very lovely. We would definitely stay again!  ,10
 Nothing we liked everything ,10
It was a wonderful two days at the hotel.  Erica and Dietrich are very friendly hospitable and careful.  Erica makes the best waffles in Belgium for breakfast.  There are many different interesting things at the hotel like in the museum.  The rooms are very stylish. And its very comfortable like at home.  Well definitely come back again. Also there lives a nice dog named Flanelle. She is a part of the domestic atmosphere of the hotel.  ,10
Erika prepared an excellent french cuisine breakfast dish every day. Very helpful couple with good knowledge of where to go and what to do in the city. Beatiful boutique style rooms. ,10
Exceptional B&B. We always receive a warm and friendly welcome it is a joy to stay at La Flaneur :)  ,10
Lovely breakfast. Less than ten min walk to centre. Great hosts. ,9
We loved the quirky nature of this B&B. Truly wonderful. Fantastic breakfast also. Difficult to fault anything.,10
The best breakfasts of our entire trip by far. A wonderful and tasty surprise every morning. It makes me want to return just to taste Erikas French toast again. Im afraid if I give an honest appraisal I will not be able to get into this wonderful B&B again. It was that good. There was nothing to be improved upon.,10
Beautiful place amazing breakfast great location. The owners are very friendly. We spent amazing time there. ,10
The charming hosts their charming home full of love and pride and the cutest little dog ever.   Breakfast was amazing every day.. There was nothing to dislike..it was perfect,10
Erika and Dietrich are just super hosts ! Kind warm & welcoming. Their place is really nice. So cosy and beautiful ! (and also very clean) With all those vintage objects everywhere you feel like in an antique market. And last but not least the breakfast is damn good +++ Dikke Merci ! ,10
Home made honey and jam yum. Very personal service. Beds very comfy All good,9.6
Friendly and very helpful host.The building had bags of character. A great stay ,9.2
Good place close to restaurants. Good breakfast (great choice) Overal good experience. Arrived a bit late so I arranger to pick up the keys by someone else with no problem. Not much of a view due to tramstation in front. During breakfast someone (owner maybe?) popped in twice and not even goodmorning. But not sure who he was just guessing.,7.5
Great location close to lots of restaurants. Quiet room at the back of the property. Check had to be between 14:00 to 15:00 or after 17:30. Breakfast not served until 09:00 but we had to leave at 08:00. Owner offered us more coffee for room which we appreciated and said althiugh breakfast setup would not be complete we could grab some bread/pastries before we left.,9.6
Good breakfast!Nice clean room Bath defective Shower was fine,9
Bed was extra comfy.  Very quirky and interesting hotel.  Very friendly staff.  Lovely breakfast. The ladder to reach the bathroom was not for the faint-hearted!  Couldnt work out how to use the coffee machine!,9.2
Excellent location near restaurants tram stop and bicycle hire shop. Very friendly and helpful staff who spoke good English. Delicious breakfast with good choices. Bedrooms very quirky but comfortable and clean. Television didnt work but we didnt really have time to watch it so forgot to mention it to the owners.,8.3
Location was perfect and it was a very calm place. The staff is nice and breakfest is great. ,10
Super detailed attention excellent breakfast with freshly baked croissants and the room was huge. The water heater turned off by itself and we didnt have hot water for a while,9
Overall very nice. A bit quirky but functional. Nice hosts. Overall very nice. A bit quirky but functional. Nice hosts.,7.9
The apartament was nice and had everything we needed for a short stay. The host was very communicative and helpful. We really appreciated the option to store our bags after the check-out. ,9
The mattress is very good (more hard than soft). The room is very large and very confortable. The blackout also works well. The only downside is some noise due to traffic in the large avenue just front as my room was facing it. In addition to some noise coming from a large avenue just in front of the room the soap and shampoo kit should improve (in confort and sustainability).,9.2
Great location. 15 minutes walk from the center. Good light breakfast. Very tasty! Very polite and helpful hosts. We could leave our bags after check-out and took them before the flight. Good place for its money. The style of this place is old-fashioned but the furniture is really old. You should be ready to have breakfast with other guests in one dinning-room. We didnt get a receipt after paying for the stay.,8.8
This B& B was excellent. The owners were lovely as was the room and facilities. Breakfast was nice too. It was a really excellent stay with everything that I needed. I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again it was very comfortable. Everything was great. I struggled to find the B&B as the little sign is quite small. I did walk past it a few times!,9.6
Lovely! Lovely house run by a considerate and kind host. Excellent location (close to the trainstation Zuid-Midi and next to the metro) also if one has oppointments in the European Quarter. Very good value for money. ,10
The very friendly Family very attentive to your comfort and wellbeing. The room was great very large very quiet just what we could wish for. It was a very pleasant stay!!! We liked everything!,10
Friendly host good breakfast good bed good & clean bathroom. ,8.3
Breakfast was served in the room and was a tasty croissant and rolls. Room was eclectically decorated which I really liked. Quirky but comfortable. Rates were very reasonable for two people. Location was good for most things but not directly central. The bathroom was a bit tired and the shower could have done with a bit of a scrub. The sinks didnt drain very well.,7
The Wifi worked.  The TV worked.  The hairdryer worked In my room there was a kettle two cups and two sugar lumps.  Draw your own conclusions.  The shower was just a dribble and it was impossible to adjust the temperature to something comfortable.  The dribble was either too hot or cold then when I tried to get it hot again it took another 3 minutes for the water to heat up.  All these people are interested in is the CASH. They dont give a damn about the guests.,4.2
Great location and some old charm character.  Clean bathroom. It is a house where a young family lives on the ground floor and rent rooms. You have to ring a bell to get attention the lady is preoccupied with her very young children (understandably) and wants to go back to her children asap. I felt that I was intruding to someones family and I tried to keep out of them as much as possible. There is no reception or entry.  The room is quaint but again like an old house: the lids of the tv hanging one has to decide either to plug the tv or the heater. The light in the bathroom is economy so it turns on after you have already been in the bathroom. Reminded me of my parents house..,6.3
Room was really clean and with a lot of style and charm. Nice place to stay and very pleasant. few steps to metro station and restaurants. ,8.8
The room hoster is very nice and kindshe is a famous kids writerÔºå The location is not easy to find,7.5
great value for money verry good beds simple but nice breakfast. verry nice location. ,9
Great Place owners were friendly and helpful we had plenty of room to park our 5 motorbikes . The rooms were tidy and all facilities were there . Overall i would definitely recommend . Breakfast was basic but nice with fresh bread and coffee etc. Location is a half hour walk to town although we didnt find it a problem  i would recommend  walking there and taxi back,9.6
The peace and quiet and breakfast was nice but a typical continental one. You were able to use the coffee machine and kettle in the kitchen if you wanted a drink. The hotel is tucked away at the top of a very narrow twisting lane but the room we had was right at the top of the building and it was virtually impossible to stand upright due to the sloping ceilings. The bathroom was shared but I knew that before booking.,9.2
Could be amazing. Beautiful building with quality annex design. Now needs a little touching up following initial conversion. Within walking distance of Namur centre but route is mixed. Late check in. Wi-fi - I could not get it to work.  No eating places nearby. Shared bathroom (although this was clearly stated),6.7
Host is nice and forthcoming. The rooms are set up nicely with attention to detail and the facilities are clean. Just to say something. It can be difficult to find. But thats all.,7.9
Real nice place and very attentive host. Perfect stop on our way to France. ,8
The host was wonderful althoug hthe breakfast was additional it was very good. Rooms are well laid out and a good size. In a bit of busy location but it was the height of summer. We had room 1 and the shower could do with a bit of TLC. The shower head would not stay up and it leaked in several places all over the bathroom floor. Had to use a towel to mop it up,7.9
 the stairs to our room were a bit challenging to climb.  also the showers were not the most user friendly.,8.3
Great location wonderful breakfast and friendly staff Rooms a bit dated and not enough hot water for the shower in the morning.,6.3
The place was perfect! The room we stayed in was very comfortable with a nice en-suite bathroom. The decoration at the whole hotel is quite old-stylish which we really enjoyed. Check-in was done very smoothly and contactless. The breakfast was delicious and the service was amazing.  The hotel is right at the beautiful beach and only a few minutes walk away from cafes and restaurants. 100% recommend ! There was nothing we didnt like this place exceeded our expectations and we would come back to stay here again!,10
The house is lovely and in a fabulous location. The owners are very friendly and helpful. The room was clean. However it would benefit from being updated.,8.3
Charming cottage in La Concession district at 100 m from the beach and the dunes. Very comfortable beds spacious apartment we had a whole floor just for us! Perfect for savoring the flavor of la belle epoque. ,10
Quiet location relatively easy access to the promenade a few hundred metres. No TV in the rooms especially in this day and age of electronics. Toilet and shower in the bedroom with open top to the room. Privacy reduced. vapour and smell can permeate the room. Toilet and washbasin very cramped especially if you are 17m or taller. I booked and paid for a normal room and a deluxe room. Both were the same. Stayed there previously and was happy with the room size on the ground floor. Not again,6.7
The property is clean and neat we did not meet any person communication seems to have difficulties by emails with the staff.,9
Its a beautiful place that feels more like a gorgeous luxurious home than a hotel. Nothing really. It was great.,10
very stylish and clean easy communication with host. could be less noice after 10pm. Old building with wooden floor so you can hear others quite loudly.,8
That two days what we spent there was beautiful two days. Thank you for the kind hospitality to the owners. ,10
Near my place of interest (Schuman) with public transport possibilities Spacious room a lot of space to leave your stuff and make yourself at home.  Tea/coffee/bottled water in the room (+chocolate/biscuits :-)  Air conditioning (very important with the humid hot weather of those days in Brussels) Very good Wifi  Books and information about Brussels and sightseeing in the room and in the common areas Very nice little garden you can spend time there reading.  Breakfast with home made bread jams and other products. Tiny details :  I didnt mind at all but very sensitive ears might find the tram circulation on the road noisy.  Walk-in shower floor was a little slippery you just need to be careful,9.2
Excellent experience only downside is that it was short! ,10
The manageress was helpful and charming and made us a lovely breakfast. Room is spacious bed is comfy. Hardly recommended ,9.6
The building was gorgeous as well as the rooms. Lola was very hospitable and accommodating. Nothing!!,10
Very kind staff gorgeous breakfast with loads of home made stuff very clean and spacious room and bathroom. Nothing.,10
Great place the owners were really friendly and helpful . Amazing breakfast We recommend this place very much  ,10
I liked almost all the parameters about this property.. host/staff location cleanliness.. could not complaint about it at allThat was one of the bestest stay I ever had Nothing .. I mean it. really nothing,10
The breakfast prepared per-demand.  Tasteful and fresh.  Home-style.  The location 2 tram-stops from the Montgomery square is very convenient.  Low cost per fairly big clean room. And they add belgian chocolate both to the room and to the breakfast :) The hydraulic elevator is very slow.  What can sometimes be disturbing is the tram.,9
Very nice breakfast: wide variety of choices and enough space in the room to eat it. ,9
I did like the good communication upfront my stay. Everything the service the breakfast the size of the room and the furniture was fine. I was also surprised by the thought-out concept behind the B&B. I also liked a lot the type of B&B allowing you to see an architecture that is different from standard hotel chains. And not to forget the breakfast that is excellent Since I was on business not enough time to enjoy. ,10
Breakfast was very good. Front of B&B was a bit noisy because of bus and tram.,9.2
Amazing comfort and view with extraordinary services. Good bed and tasty breakfast . Bed is really soft and comfortable including pillows ! Toilet paper could be softer and the table was a bit unbalanced,10
Perfect stay at B&B Living in Bresel Urban B&B. Lovely hosts room (extremely clean and comfortable) and breakfast. Ideal for family and a really nice location. Easy to get into the centre with public transport. I will book in the future! No faults,10
This b&b is the perfect accommodation on 8 walking from Jubelpark and 20 walking from the European Quarter or VUB.It has everything you need:  fully modern equipped and a nice small tiny garden. You also have a very nice  view from a window. And very clean! No negative issues,10
Super-nice place Rooms to the street are just to lud,8.5
The bedroom was spacious very clean modern and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and accommodating! good location. I definetly recommend it! ,10
So nice! You simply feel very welcome in the besutiful rooms with the best service ever. We will always come back. Thank you! ,10
The place is very clean and has everything you need. Cosy apartment comfortable bed and delicious breakfast. Totally recommended. ,10
Very friendly Host location is great breakfast was VERY good room is clean and very nice. One of the best place in Leuven and really nice to avoid Brussels high costs. ,10
Fabulous experience in all respects. The room (the triple) was spacious and very comfortable. The staff was wonderful and breakfast was delicious. Highly recommend staying here! ,10
Wonderful attention to detail.Really thoughtful.Breakfast was exceptional. Nothing.  Everything was great!,10
breakfast in the sun with nice view host room bed nothing.,9
Nice house comfortable room good breakfast extremely kind and helpful hosts ,9
Nice gentlemen running this B&B. Breakfast excellent. Room  was fine. Parking for free with Blue Parkingsign ,7.9
Great eye for detail and quality excellent breakfast ,9
Amazing rooms super convenient and thoughtful. We enjoyed the beautiful design of the house and rooms and the great breakfast. Thank you!!! ,10
What a fantastic and cosy apartment we stayed in. Spotlessly clean comfortable and cosy. Johan is the host with the most. Friendly approachable and accommodating. We will definitely use this place again.  Nothing,10
Tasty breakfast nice place very kind host. Place for car. Everything Was perfect :),10
The bed Blanket is rather warm in summer.,10
Beautiful room in a classy maison de maitre. Excellent location 20 minutes walk to downtown. Super comfortable bed room nicely decorated and furnished. Clean calm relaxing atmosphere. Hosts were friendly and welcoming respecting all Corona requirements in a positive way. Delicious breakfast in a beautiful dining room with  privacy. Will be glad to stay there again.  Liked absolutely everything.,10
A superb breakfast and very nice hospitable hosts ,9.6
Martijn and Gina were super welcoming and helpful. The apartment was clean and freshly refurnished. We really enjoyed staying with them. Gent City Center was in walking -distance. ,10
The owners were very helpful and friendly brilliant. not very private on ground floor if it was a busy time.,9.2
Hosts and facilities were excellent - hope to return for a longer stay and will definitely recommend the place to friends and family. Not applicable,10
Every thing was great The starir was a small and it was dificult to move specialy with bags other wise our staying was nice,10
Flat well kept and comfortableproperty I have already completed this before,8.8
Garage free parking located in an art gallery Wi-Fi was weak in our flat,9
Amazing hosts and 35 min stroll into the old town. If you are not good with stairs it is not the place for you.,9.6
Cosy modern studio apartment with everything we needed.  Bedroom a little bit small.,9.2
 A dryer as well as a washing machine would be of great assistance!,8.8
Very well appointed studio flat great quiet location very comfortable. Excellent breakfast option. ,10
Nice small and cozy flat with all the facilities needed for a comfortable weekend out. The hosts were also nice and we had a pair of good Belgium beers as a welcoming gift. They also offered us parking space inside the house however we were not traveling with a car :) We liked the flat a lot only the location could be closer to the downtown (but that was already expected by us). However there is a bus stop nearby and you can always take a 25 min walk like we did to the city center.,8
Breakfast was brought to my room by the owners & was excellent. A beautiful apartment & lovely hosts. I only stayed one night but would have liked to have stayed longer to explore Gent & talk more with the hosts. Nothing!,10
Very pleasant hosts quiet place. With garage and possibility to bring or rent bikes practical cycling distance from the city. ,10
Stylish Belgium house. Fantastic home-like breakfast - even we have paid quite a lot for it it was worthy to it. I do not recommend for older people due to steep and narrow stairs to our apartment. No chance to get there any heavy luggage for them. But for us it was no problem. P.S. other apartments were probably different with more easier approach.,9.6
Great helpful friendly host. Comfortable apartment. Quiet surrounding. Nothing,9
Otherwise a nice comfortable modern flat with everything you need. Supermarket and shops very close. Quite handy for center by car or bus. Nice shower but surprised it was not on thermostatic control for such a modern installation temperature regulation was difficult. Arrival arrangements were not as indicated. Telephone on answerphone so could not contact owner about entry. Doorbell at flat confused several people including us not clearly marked.Apparently this will be sorted out shortlyStairs quite steep for going down due to Z shaped treads and risers.,8
Excellent host. Most helpful and welcoming with two beers cooling in fridge. Couple of dead flies lying around and as ground floor studio could hear person upstairs stomping about. Not they best sleep.,7.9
Great location very comfortable room finished to a very high standard. The hosts were very welcoming and went out if their way to accommodate me. Plus theres a beer waiting for you in the fridge!  Nothing,10
Large apartment well equipped and very nice people. It was in an excellent location with a supermarket close by. The place was quiet and very comfortable and I would stay there again. Thanks to my hosts who were great. There is nothing I can put here. The place and my hosts were great.,10
Very spacious and well equipped appartment which was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and the hosts were very friendly. The steep stairs leading up to the apartment are scary.,9
Private garage parking. Very comfortable beds. Excellent breakfast worth the extra charge. Nothing,8.8
Owner had many years of running this b&b and it showed. Professional but warm welcome.  Excellent facilities and breakfast. Interesting area as well and I wished I could have stayed a bit longer. ,9.2
Owners were nice and welcoming and friendly and spoke very good English. We were late getting to the b and b but with a quick email they were very happy to accommodate waiting up for us to get to them.Breakfast was amazing lots of different options to choose from and the owners were quick bringing out the hot choice of breakfast. Very happy with the service which was included. Thank you so much we will be back again.  ,10
Wonderful hostesswho had a lot on her  mindbut was 110% Compact room and shower,7.5
Very friendly hosts well decorated room quiet at night very nice breakfast The bed and pillow was soft for my taste however everything was clean and I still slept fine,9.2
Friendly welcome great area convenient for city and country Small room,6.3
Wonderful country side villa. Breakfast homemade warm owners. Everything perfect!  ,9.6
We loved the layed-back atmosphere in spite of corona. The location is charming rural but a couple of minutes away from the city of Maastricht by bike. The room was very small really had to manoeuvre around the bathroom. Would choose a bigger room if possible next time.,9
Beautiful old main building well kept in authentic style. Annex is nicely decorated. Nice bathroom and good bed.  Street noise as lacking double glass windows.,7
The friendly host above everything else made sure we had everything we needed and offered local advice about whatever we asked about. Absolutely nothing to say even while COVID19 doesnt allow serving breakfast - we had a fully equipped kitchen to utilise. Very accommodating!,10
Amazing hostess and great breakfast. The room was very spacious and luxurious. A great place to stay when visiting Liege. ,9.6
Fantastic room great location super friendly hosts fab breakfast Matrasses were too hard for good nights sleep. At least for us,9.6
The room number 5 was outstanding we did not expect it to be so nice.  The bubble bath was very comfortable.  Breakfast was really good with a lot of cheeses.  Owners and staff are very friendly.  Will stay again. ,10
very beautiful B&B  very good Breakfast ,10
It was a wonderful stay. Denise is very kind the room very comfortable and the breakfast in the beautiful dining room is great. We loved our stay and will definitely repeat if we go back to Liege. -,9.6
Room size bathroom and little touches they add to make you feel special the breakfast is a Downton Abbey feel.  Our stay was too short,9.6
Genial.Extremely clean comfortable and beautiful. We appreciated the little details and the flexibility great breakfast great hosts great place. ,10
Lovely B&B. The only thing is that the breakfast is not included in the price of the bed and breakfast. It isnt mentioned you have to pay extra on top of your stay. So that was a surprise. Cause the owner wasnt present when we had to pay I emailed her about this (twice) but she didnt replay at all. That a shame. ,8.3
Beautiful room in an ancient bourgeois house renovated with taste and some modern touch. Enjoyed the sauna the excellent breakfast and the location in the historical heart of Liege. ,9.6
Everything was perfect. This is the second 10 I give in 5 years of using booking. ,10
Beautiful building original main house and super renovation in the other.  The bed was very comfortable and breakfast superb. Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from the square in front until late.  There are a lot of drunks etc. in Liege unfortunately.  Its such a shame - a perverse difference between the superb cultural scene and people in the saddest situation..not the fault of the B&B of course but the local government could be doing a lot more to help this appalling drugs problem that Liege clearly has.,8
Not sure where to start! A very warm welcome from the very friendly owners who showed us to our rooms which were just stunning. They have clearly spared no expense to build perhaps one of the most comfortable B&Bs we have ever stayed in-  fabulous bed and a big fan in the 35 C heat! To finish a delicious breakfast in a stunning breakfast room ,10
Excellent cleanliness excellent room excellent room. Excellent breakfast  No official hotel parking,9.6
Un unexpected immersion in taste for design and hospitality. The history of the project speaks itself. Denise the owner is magnifique no other words are required. No plugs bed side.,10
Beautifully appointed rooms great attention to detail and friendly hosts. A lovely stay overall! ,9
We absolutely loved this place. It all felt so luxurious. The room (we had room 5) was gorgeous. Everybody was super friendly. The breakfast was fantastic and the location is perfect. We only stayed for one night but we will definitely come back to stay longer.  ,10
This place is simply outstanding. The decor is beautiful. The bedroom we had was out of this world. This beats amy 5 star hotel!! Breakfast was also fab!! Nothing. All wonderful,10
Lovely designed spaces of the actual lodging. Owners were very informative of the area history & food recommendations. Wish we had more time in Liege. Not enough time to lazily enjoy the area.,10
great building dutch spoken nothing maybe a bit noisy in morning outside(but just a bit i am a nag) i will come back,10
Very attractive large attic room Friendly and helpful owner.Splendid breakfastsGreat location  Nothing,10
It was absolutely perfect. The room is beautifully decorated so much attention to detail. Even though you are only a 5 minute walk away from some of the main attractions it is completely quiet. The garden is a hidden gem. The hostess was extremely kind and helpful. I can highly recommend this guest house.  ,10
Friendly staff felt like home. Well located  just a walk to lots and lots of bars.  I know as my husband took me to most of them. Very steep shallow stairs.,10
We loved everything about B&B 11 Exclusive Guesthouse.  The location was close to the main square and easy to get to.  My husband and I stayed in the 1st floor suite.  It had a separate entrance living room small kitchen large bedroom and bathroom.  It was extremely clean and the hosts of the B&B were wonderful.  We enjoyed breakfast each morning and great conversation with other guest.  The host of the B&B provided great instruction on what to do and see along with options for restaurants.  The next time we visit Brugge we will definitely stay at B&B 11. We liked everything about B&B 11 Exclusive Guesthouse.,9.6
This place has a great location beautiful rooms lovely staff and a fantastic breakfast. ,10
Room host location breakfast everthing was so good. Highly recommended. Stairs are painful especially with a luggage.,8.8
Really loved the location tucked away from the hustle and bustle but close to the city centre and attractions. Staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was really lovely.  The bed was quite uncomfortable as were the pillows. Perhaps if a mattress topper was added to the double bed (which is two single units put together - very common and necessary in these old houses with steep stairs! Almost impossible to install a double bed) and larger pillows provided we would have had a most restful break.,8.3
We loved the location the style the room the staff...absolutely one of the best places weve stayed. The interior design was excellent as was the garden. Taniya and Murielle made us feel very welcome and did everything they could to make our stay special.,10
Everything was amazing! Incredibly friendly and helpful hosts. We loved our stay and would definitely love to come back. ,10
Great location. Very helpful staff with great recommendations for the best places to visit. Very private and perfect for a couples getaway. ,10
The building is lovely with heavy oak beams contemporary decor and quality fittings and furnishings.  Very accommodating and available host. The floor boards in our loft room did creak a lot but I guess that was just part of the character.,10
The bed was super comfy and a big bathbforn2 that fills up rather quickly. And as we had the suite we had a private entrance. I think a small scale boutique hotel should be able to provide non plastic free products something more ecological. For example portioned jams and butter plastic coffee capsules & plastic bottles water.  I would prefer to see more care and thought in this area.,9.2
The property was in a great location great sized suite and a great breakfast:) Nothing,10
We loved the everything about the property! It was beautifully decorated in other middle of town and managers were a pleasure to interact with. We would stay again!  Amazing time Im Brugge! Nothing,10
Very well located comfortable property.  Staff was exceedingly personable. ,10
Fantastic place wonderful location great breakfast & a warm welcome. Well be back! ,10
We had a wonderful time!The room was beautiful the breakfast amazing and our host very friendly and helpful!If you want to come to Brigge its the perfect place to stay! ,10
breakfast was normal nothing special. Location very good. ,9
The location of this beautiful guesthouse was perfect for exploring Bruges which in itself is a magical place. The house is wonderfully decorated and furnished with many lovely little touches. Breakfast was perfect and the owner of the guesthouse a pleasure to speak to and very informative and helpful. ,9
The bed was crisp clean and extra comfy. The breakfast was absolutely beautifully presented. Our host Tania couldnt have been more accommodating. ,9.2
Location size of room great attention to detail Nothing at all,10
Everything was great. The owners take care of every detail in this B&B. Breakfast is azing with all home made food we liked especially the jams the yogurt and the fresh bread. It is also close to many WWI sites by bike or by car. ,10
Lovely hosts beautiful house and garden fabulous breakfast!  We recommend this B & B without hesitation and we plan to make a return visit. ,10
Its the third time we have stayed at this super property..........I think that says enough ? beautiful house superb hosts. If only you could award 11 out of 10 !! ,10
Very nice stay. Place is comfortable and styled in a warm and origanal stile. Hosts are very welcomming and breakfast is just fabulous. Unfortunately there was an unusually loud party going on late in the night by the neighbours. No fault of the owners but it messed with my sleep. Great beds also. Loud neighbours. Didnt like that but not owners fault.,8.8
Breakfast was fantastic as with out previous stay. Outside in the garden with home picked fruits home made yoghurt fresh eggs from their own hens and honey from their bees. The best breakfast we have had in a bed and breakfast and is our standard to beat. Rooms very comfortable and as it hit 40 degrees on our visit the air conditioning in the bedroom was fantastic. nothing,10
Really friendly and helpful hosts in a super property Nothing,10
Very clean rooms. Very friendly hosts. Amazing breakfast made from locally produced products. It was great. I highly recommend it to everyone wanting to discover the neighborhood around Ieper ,9.6
The personal service was excellent: Breakfast served on the terrace one day and an  in room breakfast for the day we had an early departure the room wasnt overly clean (dust) and sound proofing to other rooms / staircase is not the greatest. There is only street parking and not in front of the house.,7.5
Verry friendly and kind host Bathroom a little bit poor,8.3
The friendly host and her lovely son. The feeling of being welcome. My cup of coffee in the garden before breakfast. The pillows..,9.2
The region. The WiFi worked very well. It was quiet. Not at all Pittoresque! No parking many stairs to climb before you enter the house no WC in the room or bath room very small bathroom with a very small washbasin without plug that would rather expect in a toilet breakfast OK but by no means something special as described on their website,5.4
A typical farm breakfast. Natalie was an awesome hostess and so friendly and nice.  If your an American visiting Bastogne the surrounding battlefields  american cemetaries its a perfect location Nothing at all,10
Beautiful location and host.  Picturesque is the perfect description for the outlook from the property over the city. ,10
Very friendly welcome excellent breakfast! ,8.3
Host was great. Very friendly helpful and spoke English. Breakfast was served in quiet front room with cooked to order eggs and good coffee ,8.5
Lovely warm welcome and communication was good from the booking onwards. Beautiful location nice breakfast and very comfortable.  ,10
The hostess was incredibly welcoming receiving us with a smile on her face. The room and beds were great with on top of that an excellent breakfast. I would 100% recomment it to any possible future guest. ,10
Gorgeous view from our room over Houffalize! The breakfast was delicieus with lots of variety. Infrastructure is outdated because of single wall glass and creeky floor.,8
Nathalie took very good care of us. It was a warm welcome and a very nice room. The breakfast was very good. I can only recomend this place.  ,9.6
Host was very kind and welcoming we felt at home during our stay.  Houffalize is very beautifull location to stay while visiting the Ardennes. We expected more of the breakfast.  Even though we knew beforehand the toilet was not in the room it was still annoying.,7.5
The lady was very friendly and helpful. Even adjusted breakfast to my diet. It was excellent,9.2
Super helpful owner very clean comfy bed and great location. The only small thing is that is a 3rd floor with no lift something common in these buildings.,10
Personable helpful hosts easy check-in great breakfast newer plumbing fixtures (modern and easy to use) cool decor great selection of books on Brussels to browse quiet street near the Cinquantenaire Park and EU area. ,9.6
It is perfectly located near to European institutions. The owners are really nice friendly and helpful. Breakfast is amazing better than 5 stars hotels. The room in well equipped new and clean and the bathroom has a lot of space big shower. Definitively the best option in Brussels. ,10
My son said that the upstairs apartment  where we were put up  is like a den but in a good way. We really had our little place with a kitchen great sitting spaces and even a selection of DVDs. The good thing about the location is that there are some great cafes restaurants close by as well as a Sunday market on Place Jourdan. (We chose the location for Autoworld in Parc Cinquantenaire.) Although the Etterbeek neighborhood is great this place is a wee bit too far from the metro stations if you need to get around by public transport. Plus the host persuaded us not to have breakfast (saving 40$ althogether though) while other guests could have it.,9.2
Excelent. The place is perfet the size of the rrom ans bathroom the localisation and breakfast are great!! The eindow curtins did not block the light. For people that do not sleep with ligh is dificult,8.8
i like this very much! there are no negative things,10
Lovely welcome. Really clean and real attention to detail with the lovely breakfast. Thank you! Nothing,10
Apartment is central close to venue. It is clean and the area is very quiet Nothing really as although I did not meet hosts personally we had a good communication channel via email,10
Pleasant welcoming owner good breakfast.  ,10
An incredibly cosy place really close to the European Quarter (where cosy accommodation is very hard to get). Everything has a friendly colourful and human touch to it while it still remains trendy and clean. The owners are extremely lovely and nothings ever a problem for them. The room had everything I could possibly need and was very peaceful.  The breakfast was always a highlight of my day  beautifully presented with so many great healthy and not-so-healthy options combining organic and locally produced goodies with Belgian classics. This was my second time in B&B Place Jourdan and I hope to come back again. Everything was great.,10
perfect location in center very helpful owners comfort ,10
Everythingfrom the location to the roomsbathrooms and the breakfast with the lovely atmosphere and music was perfect. The staff was really friendly and I will definitely stay with you again when coming back to Brussels. I just loved it. Thank you!,10
I really like the location close to Jourdan (cool bars and places to eat) and also close to the EU district which was great for me because I was travelling for work.  The owners were nice very kind.  The breakfast was great! Offered in a very speical way as well :) Comfy bed. My room was quite dusty so it didnt feel very clean. It was a very sunny day when I arrived and when I sat on the bed a cloud of dust went up. The stairs to the top floors are very narrow and steep. Which is fine but a bit inconvenient when carrying a suitcase.,7.9
The bed was very comfortable and large and the room spacious and very clean. The breakfast was also great because the owner brings fresh bred and croissants every morning. The area to have breakfast is really small so if there are more people who want to have breakfast at the same time it might be a little bit crowded: there are only two small tables.,10
excellent breakfast great location for me (close to EU buildings) a small kettle to make tea in the room would be good. Stairs are OK for me but could be difficult for some.,7.9
The space the kitchen the new and spacious bathroom.. very nice place for 4 guests too!! Not really suitable for people with mobility problems (high 3rd floor) for everyone else perfect!!!,9.5
Enough space clean and friendly service A bit away from metro station,9
Very friendly host. Very quiet over night. Very small table - not really appropriate for work.,8
3rd or 4th visit just right for my purposes. Less strairs!,10
Great premises very helpful and pleasant proprietor and in a good location for me! ,10
amazingly comfortable and big bed pleasant atmosphere at breakfast thanks to the room and music the offer was of everything and there were instructions at wall (e.g. to boil the egg)  owners ready to help  really close to Place Jourdan the lighting in room - I would prefer more / stronger,9
Loved the relaxing friendly environment of the beautiful house and grounds. The kids loved running around the gardens food was excellent and Axel and Guy delightful hosts. Will be coming back!  ,10
excellent add  light to the morocco room,10
The room is beautiful!! With a beautiful view! Amazing old wooden beams and doors with a lovely Moroccan theme. We had two sinks which was fun and the shower is great. ,10
Pronkenburg was a charming bed & breakfast on a farm and we had a unique picturesque room where our daughter had her own little nook with a cot and her own window which she loved. The proprietors were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was delicious. There was a fireplace in the living room and a cellar with cold drinks so we could relax in the evenings. Also there is a delicious restaurant very nearby where we had delicious steaks. ,10
Very good service very kind people I would recommend everybody to go there I will rate this place 10 out of 10 hospitable joy your pool without most information available quiet through nature beautiful gardens lovely atmosphere yes 100% full with pleasure I like the atmosphere I liked the quietness I liked the people hospitable I liked that restaurants were reachable by walking distance I liked that everything was provided with at most joy I have never experienced such a wonderful stay and I recommend that they have to be with another star so 10 out of 10+ one,10
Excellent location very nice place charming old house. The living room with the open fire is fantastic. Beautiful garden. Very nice warm welcome and good breakfast. ,8
The house is gorgeous and the homemade breakfast is good/different. The man of the house is very friendly and fun to talk to. Our bedroom in the loft was beautiful but not very comfortable. The bathroom had no shower.,8.3
Gia was a superb host and so friendly.  The breakfast was excellent and the room and bathroom were absolutely as I would expect. Really nothing.  The only issue was how hot it was at night but that is in no way connected to the owner as it was a heatwave.  She tried to make it better by buying an air cooler which unfortunately was ineffective but it shows the effort she went to.,10
The host was super friendly and nice! She prepared an amazing breakfast for me and my girlfriend and when we needed to store our stuff and pick them up later she was super accommodating!  The bed was also really comfortable! I would definitely recommend it and I would for sure visit again!! --,9.6
Perfect location in Antwerp. Hospitable host who accommodated our late arrival. Free public parking near the B&B by the water. Antwerp is a great city! Bathroom was outside the room (a curtained corridor to the bathroom). Room needs a bit of maintenance (loose lamps and things like that). Two separate mattresses instead of a king-size bed.,7.1
Excellent location. The room is clean cozy and authentic. In 300 meter aprox there is free parking. The stuff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast was absolutely amazing. A lot of thanks! It was a great time in Antwerpen. I strongly recommend ,9.2
Superb host and location. Comfy bed and one of the best and diverse continental breakfasts weve had. Parking is free as advertised approx 400m along the River Schelde. -,9.2
The place is really nice and its location is very central. The owners are super friendly and warm. We enjoyed the breakfast a lot .. 500 m away there is a free car park. With some luck you can get a free car park in front of Hotel Sandt. However its a public car park and cant be booked in advance. We would surely stay here again. :-) ,10
Warm welcome by lovely hosts amazing breakfast beautiful city! ,9.2
Lovely quiet neighbourhood near Brussels Centre ideal! Room and bathroom were excellent in this lovely house with wooden floors. Breakfast was superb everything bio. The host was very friendly :) Sadly the heating was broken. Didnt matter much thanks to the lavish blankets!,9
Very nice host good location if you want to explore the south eastern parts of Brussels. Tram/subway connection to downtown and trainstationQuiet neighborhood. You will be the only guests and can enjoy the carefully renovated  classic Brussels house. 2nd floor is all yours. ,10
The owner is a very nice person. Her home is very cozy and clean. Delicious breakfast. I would highly recommend. If I have the opportunity I will definitely come back here. ,9.2
Good service cosy atmosphere calm location. Nothing to complain. ,10
This B&B was beyond expectation the host made us feel like wed be her personal guests rather than just hiring an accommodation. Its location is not at the city centre but getting there with public transportation is rather quick & easy and if one is driving parking infront of the house is free. The area is quiet and safe. The nearest restaurants are a few minutes walk away. ,10
Just one word. Perfect. 10 Points nothing to add. ,10
The view is amazing and Claudine (the owner is super nice and cheerful) ,10
I recommend B&B Salve It was a really nice experience. Claudine is a fantastic host we really enjoyed breakfast and a good conversation about Brussels from a local. 10/10 ,9
Everything was fantastic! Claudine was such an amazing host. Very helpful and friendly. Besides she is a wonderful cook. She made us feel at home. The room was super clean bed pillows and linen extra comfy. Shower with nice warm water. The wifi was very fast. There are lots of restaurants at a 10 min walking distance. The Neighborhood is nice and quiet mostly family residences. Perfect for walking.  We are already planning our next stay with Claudine. Highly recommended!!  Thank you Claudine for everything you definitely made our stay more pleasant. Big hugs from Mexico! There was nothing to dislike.,10
Great welcome comfortable room lovely breakfast Nothing. All excellent,10
What a wonderful house!! We stayed just one night but it was like being at home. Super nice breakfast. nothing..maybe the parking is not easy but several options close by.,9.6
The B&B is in a quiet location and it is extremely clean and tidy. The host is very friendly and the breakfast she offers is fresh tasty and hygienic. I will recommend this B&B as I have no complaints or see no shortcomings.,10
The owner is really nice hospitable and helpful in giving advices and help.The structure is really nice confortable and clean. Feeling at home.Very close to EU Commission offices. ,10
very nice beautiful quiet house. House owner is so warm and helpful! ,10
It was a very pleasant stay as our hosts were very attentive to our comfort. We had a comfortable room although bathroom and toilet are shared. Small but thoughtful tokens such as candies in a basket for guests were much appreciated. The neighbourhood is pleasant and there is ample parking at the residence. ,10
super quant super clean close enough to the city to enjoy far enough to have peace and quiet /,9
Friendly host very clean bedroom and breakfast area comfortable bed private bathroom and continental  breakfast. Parking space on the premise. Being both 1m80 tall the bathroom was very uncomfortable for us. We had to walk bended over towards the toilet and could hardly sit upright on it. There was only a bath no shower (again you could not stand upright but had to sit ) It is a real challenge not to bang your head due to the declining ceiling.,8
The breakfast was first class. I have Coeliac disease which proved no problem to my hosts who went out of their way to get me gluten free bread. The room was very clean furnished well with a lovely comfortable bed. I was very much made to feel at home and I will certainly return on my next visit. ,10
Amita and her husband were so welcoming. Her advice on where to visit and other information in the local area and amenities was invaluable. The accommodation was excellent. We would definitely stay again and recommend the b&b ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ,10
Very comfortable and cosy nice room and breakfast gentle host its a nice place to stay very quiet too nothing special,9.6
Anita was a great host who was able to give us guidance about  getting around the area. The room was clean and pleasant  with a comfortable bed.  Parking at the house was an added bonus. Driving into Ghent from here was not a problem. The bedroom is on the second floor with a shared shower and sink on that level. The toilet is on the first floor --down several steps. We were fine with this arrangement but if one has difficulty with stairs it may be a challenge.,8.3
Sandrina was  amazing person she  was  very helpful and we  felt  soo comfortable in that  facility. Thank you. The  honest   message  for the  owner: cleanliness need  to have  clean floor unfortunately   we did  not  have  that  luckbut hopefully   next  time  )),9
Nice room with comfortable bed and bathroom in a nice house with design accents The host did not stay during the night but was super friendly in the morning presenting breakfast The cat inside could not get out due to misunderstanding and so she took part of our night sleep  Breakfast was more than okay  a little bit expensive though,9
Free carpark. Nice room with a good bed and bathroom. Distance from the centre of Namur is about 30 minutes walk. 2 Cats in the house causes a lot of cathair laying around in the B&B.  Price of is much to high for a overnight stay.,5.4
A lovely short stay in Namur. Well equipped comfortable room parking too. Perfectly positioned to walk to the towns bars and cafes. Our host was lovely definitely recommend. ,9
The quiet area close to main attractions  The noises with the other tourists that were there if they speak you can hear everything from your room,8
Owner is very kind and ready to help for anything.  Location is good for town visits and accomodation in line with expectations. Owner has another nice B&B (Villa Barabas) with even higher standards where we were decided to take lunch after forgetting to order one at Villa Vanille. ,9
Leila is a good host she will go out of her way to make you feel welcome. The rooms are very clean and stylish the location is very quiet an not to far from the town center highly recommended.  ,9.2
 Good location for people with cars so that you can have easier travel in and out of Brugge. Not a good location to visit Brugge if youre a quick Traveller with bags as you have to take a bus. ,8.8
We had a very nice stay at this quiet friendly cosy little accommodation! Thank you for the special service! ,10
Lovely house with charming details in a very peaceful and relaxing setting. Quick and easy to get to Bruges by car. Room was spacious and comfortable with a lovely terrace overlooking the field and with lovely sunset views. Great shower. Tasty breakfast and welcoming hosts who gave us a lot of great recommendations for things to see. Would definitely stay there again. -,9.6
The rooms are excellent value for money the owners are very friendly and helpful throughout the stay. Lots of information given on the surrounding area and best ways to get there. The breakfast is amazing too.  No problems or faults with the property or staff.,10
Extremely warm welcome.  The property was located in a quiet area not far from the E40 for our onward journey to the Channel Tunnel.  Fantastic breakfast ,9.6
Excellent breakfast. Calm location Some spiders in the room. Beds not confortable at all. Very expensive,7
The B&B is located in what feels like a wonderfully hidden corner of true Flanders (even though the entry to the highway is close) -  located alongside the canal between Ostend and Bruges great for walking or biking  and with views on fields and sheep from the bedroom window. The house itself is also interesting -  while the house has been re-organized for B&B purposes historical and personal touches remain including art.  The breakfast served in the former living/dining room of the house is a real treat the hosts are friendly and service-oriented and yes everything is very clean.   We loved our stay there and recommend it highly. ,9
Amazingly friendly host (providing information about city visits and cultural activities) possibility to store our bikes in a little shed nice clean room with everything one needs for a comfortable stay (super comfy mattress) rich breakfast quite area close to the Bruges-Ostend canal perfect for cyclists and nature lovers ,10
Very good host and excellent breakfast. Nice experience ,10
The host is very welcomeing and it is very careful at details. This B&B is one of the best I have ever seen. Good breakfast in calm and relaxing atmosphere.  0 :),9.6
Hosts were very friendly and welcoming. They accommodated our needs for an earlier breakfast serving which was much appreciated. Very comfortable stay. A very good restaurant is directly across the street from the B&B. We ate there two nights in a row. Room was not serviced daily.,8.8
The hosts were extremely helpful kind and friendly.  Breakfast was excellent and the atmosphere in the breakfast room was just wonderful. The room was spacious and modern bed was very comfortable. Very calm quiet and peaceful stay. Good restaurant just across the street. Maybe staying here is not the best alternative for travellers without a car. It is not easy to reach with public transport. The hosts however helped as much as possible with getting to Bruges.,9.6
Excellent for cycling between Oostende and Brugge the style of the house ,9
Good choice for breakfast quality ingredients.  Good size family room.  Accomodating and friendly host. Unfortunately property was unable to accept payment by credit card.  Lots of mosquitoes in the room.,8.8
The host is an absolute delight very welcoming hospitable and kind. Room good. The stairs are steep but fine. Breakfast excellent. Thoroughly recommended.  ,9.2
The breakfast was amazing. All fresh food and huge choice. Excellent! I didnt like the fact that our toilet and bathroom were not en suite although they were private facilities to us. It just meant we had to go out our room to use the facilities.,9.6
This was my second stay here and it was just as good. Comfortable room and the best breakfast. A really convenient location for all of the sites of Ypres. I would highly recommend. Nothing,10
the house itself is lovely the garden the breakfast Towels need to be replaced with new ones.  They are very worn out.,7.5

Breakfast was amazing. Everything you could possibly want and then more. The staff were exceptional. The room a little small but comfortable clean and quiet. Nothing,10
Copious breakfast central but quiet location friendly host  Room was nice and clean but a bit cramped for a family of five,7.9
Good location only a few minutes walk from the town centre. Breakfast had an excellent selection of food available. ,10
We liked everything it was within walking distance  to what we went to see and I would stay there again There was nothing I didnt like about the b&b,10
Wow where do I start?  Everything was amazing our room was spotlessly clean very comfortable and the shower was excellent.  Location of the property is perfect for walking into town.  The breakfast choices were incredible much more than in big hotel chains.  We have stayed in Ypres several times and will definitely book here again when we are next in the area. ,10
Good location easy to walk into the centre of town. On street parking (watch out for different zones where time is limited / charges) We had two double rooms one had a small en-suite the other had its own toilet and shower facilities just outside the room.  Tea / coffee making facilities on landing. Lovely  roof terrace and / or garden to sit out in. Breakfast was amazing! Stairs are quite steep with narrow treads not easy for people with mobility issues. Mattresses were soft but that is down to personal preference.,9.2
Great location friendly host comfortable beds amazing breakfast!! Couldnt ask for more!. N/a,10
The location superb breakfast wonderful comfort lots of caring little details and the owner was stupendous Absolutely everything was great.,10
Beautiful garden and roof terrace to relax inGaraged parking for my motorbike  ,10
The breakfast was superb particularly the bacon eggs cooked to order. There were multi choices to suite eveyone Very friendly atmosphere enhanced by access for most to roof garden It was difficult to get a good nights sleep with noise from the traffic below seeming to go on all night. Lots of roadworks nearby.,9.2
Made to feel very welcome by Magda. Secure motorcycle parking in garage. Room was in a separate block overlooking the garden with own street access. Large modern room with great facilities & bathroom. Breakfast had a good choice and Magdas bacon & eggs are a real treat! Easy walk to the main square. Not able to check in until 17:00 (Sunday),10

Location friendliness accommodation all was good. That we hadnt got a longer stay missing already.,10
The breakfast was excellent one of the best Ive had. The water pressure in the bathroom very good.  Fair location about 15 minute walk to Menin Gate.  That the apartment was upstairs and outside.,9.6
Sun terrace and view of garden was beautiful.  Room rather quirky - small but adequate. Door to room rattled whever anyone came near. Shared Tea/coffee making facilities on landing and not in every room. Diffcult to drag our large case upstairs with no lift and no assistance.,7.5
Lovely friendly welcome - beautiful house and garden and great breakfast provided. Very convenient for everything we wanted. A lovely host Nothing comes to mind,9.6

Nice walk into the main tourist areas. Lovely breakfast. Nice veranda attached to the room even though we didnt have time to use it properly. Parking just a little down the street from the property. Arrived in the evening so there were spaces but it wasnt entirely clear where was ok and where wasnt.,8.8
It was all perfecteven in the smallest details and a very warm welcome. ,10
We stayed in the family suite which exceeded our expectations in every way. Have stayed at the hotel many times and would recommend. Just a short drive to the centre of Ypres. Nothing,10
Amazing - room lovely situation very handy for centre of YpresBreakfast amazing! Nothing - it was lovely,10
Room was spartanly furnished but comfortable. Breakfast selection was amazing! Access to my room up an exterior narrow circular metal staircase was awkward with luggage and would not be possible for anyone with mobility issues. Parking is wherever you can find it on neighboring streets.,9.6
Host great.lovely breakfast and a good location to the centretea t Tea and coffee facilities outside of room,9
Excellent location only a short walking distance to the city centre. Excellent breakfast with a broad choice of everything plus bacon & eggs.Attentive host Magda.  Parking on street limited to 3 hours during the working week.,9.6

Very friendly host clean rooms and very good breakfast The step up to the room and bathroom was a little bit dangerous,9
Breakfast was the biggest spread i have ever seen! great. this didnt affect us just be aware this is not a place for the infirm the stairs are very narrow,8
Good location for last post ceremony at Menin Gate ,8.3
The house was spotless. The food was excellent especially the eggs and bacon which was a surprise. The bathroom is really small.,9
Great Bed and Breakfast close to Menin Gate and Square for the price we paid we thought it was excellent. We will return. Nothing.,10
Very accommodating  for us and our 3 children. Breakfast was fantastic and location was great.  Walking distance to town centre Nothing I didnt like,10
Very friendly welcome. Recieved a booklet for discounts in Ieper. Helped with parking.  ,10
Breakfast was freshly cooked by host which was delicious.  Very quiet location great nights sleep.  Very close walking distance to centre of town.  Beautiful garden beautiful house. Would have liked to stay for more than 1 night maybe next time we visit Ypres well stay for longer.,10

Very nice home friendly host and everything we needed and more for our stay. Good location. Thank you  ,8.3
Magda as always was a fantastic host. Everything was as we expected super clean with a superb breakfast spread. Nothing is to much trouble & it is our go to place when staying in or around Ypres. ,10
Great. Location gorgeous gardens and lots of amenities  Nothing,10
Booked the same day and allowed to check in early. Lovely breakfast. Comfortable space. ,10
Good location. Lovely deck to sit out and relax. Great breakfast. Room and bathroom were smaller than  expected from pictures. Parking a bit of a hassle as it is three hours only on the street during the day. Were told we could park at the small mall next door but when we asked they said only when we were shopping there and the manager was fed up with the B&B telling people they could park there. They also lock the gate at 6 pm so if you havent moved your car you are out of luck.,7.5
The owner was lovely and the breakfast was amazing! ,9
Beautiful huge room/suite with jacuzzi in the bathroom. The bed was big en very comfortable. The neighbourhood has many many restaurants to take-away food (and have dinner in regular times I suspect) and in the shared kitchen there are glasses/cutlery etc. The TV had Netflix which was nice as well. Good breakfast as well especially seeing that they had to organise it just for us. We were the only guests (COVID!) but I suspect the building may be a bit noisy (creaky floors etc) when other guests are there. This would personally not bother me but might be good to know if you are a light sleeper.,9
Perfect place to stay feels very much at home hope to stay again. Spacious beautiful details comfortable very friendly. Beautiful shared space and kitchen on the ground floor. ,10
Space decoration amenities Door is a bit difficult to handle but everything else makes up for a little inconvenient,10
Although we visited B&B The Good House during the covid period the staff was super friendly and did everything so we could still enjoy our stay as much as possible. ,9
Big room with a big comfortable bed and a tv with netflix and amazone prime. I only booked this B&B because I was looking for a stay with a whirlpool in the room. There was one in the bathroom but It didnt work so that was really disappointing since that was the only reason to be there. Later I was looking at google reviews and saw someone with the same complaint and this review was from more than 5 months ago and yet now 5 months later it was still not working.,6
I would have like if no one would have had the next. I think they should try to work on the walls of the rooms. they should try to work on the vicinity of this hotel  it was quite good.. it is really hot at night when will try to open the window down for some breeze. the mosquitoes were so much we couldnt sleep from the noise of the mosquitoes on our here. the problem I have with this hotel is the rooms was loud everything that the next lodger was doing I could hear. I couldnt sleep for one night because half the next room beside us the customers was very loud with sex.. the lady was screaming all through the night or throughout the mornings with the loud music as well. that was not comfortable.,7
Super luxurious and spacious room! The design and interior are sublime. Extremely bad isolation and the host was not present during the night. The people that were renting the other room were extremely loud and unrespectful until 2 in the morning.,7
Very nice modern b&b - what a view :). If you like Domotica then you will like this B&b. Lady of the house is very friendly! Nice breakfast. And important very Good coffee Tea and water is included. /,10
The house is outstanding as a B&B Location hosts the welcome breakfast house itself.  Everything was exceptionally good. A walk through a woodland path leads into Bessegem which has VG eating places and excellent transport connections. The house is a modern build and is on the river over which there are excellent views.  You can watch the barges glide quietly by.  If you wish the dawn can fill your room with light Nothing!!,10
This location is awesome!!!! Best place to stay in the Flanders area and I have stayed at places in Gent Bruges etc.. The view is just breathtaking!!!!!  the owners are so kind and wonderful...My 7 year grandson told me the best breakfast and place in the world!!!! Nothing!,10
What a fabulous place. The hosts are charming and very helpful. The room is modern and well proportioned. Breakfast is a real treat. Nothing,10
Loved the view over the river from the bed! Breakfast was so good & very healthy comfortable bed and great bathroom - the photos dont do it justice.  A great place to stay and a lovely walk along the river into Kortrijk for lunch - Highly recommended  ,10
Technically very well done installations.  Very nice. Perfectly arranged b&b. Superb breakfast and helpful service. I will come back.,10
The room location excellent for single travellers and the hospitality of the owners. No complaints,10
Excellent location and lovely owner who made me feel at home. I would highly recommend staying. ,8.8
You can easily find accommodation. You can relax in a pleasant peaceful environment near the city center. The hostess was very kind-hearted. Breakfast was varied and delicious. I can recommend it to everyone. ,10
Hostess with the mostest! Lovely breakfast very comfortable bed sink in the room was appreciated (there is a shared bathroom for guests) clean and welcoming. Mieke is a lovely lady who was extremely helpful. Enjoyed going on a bike tour with her! No air conditioning/fan. Steep stairs would be difficult to manoeuvre for someone with a physical disability.,8.8
Everything was awesome location good hostess awesome ,10
Super friendly hostess who made delightful breakfast for us and gave us a map with information about places to visit At the street side the street lantern was close to the window which attracted a lot of spiders. The arachnophobe in me wasnt super thrilled about this.,8.8
The breakfast was excellent and the host prepared a different variation every day ,9
The owner  was very helpful. The breakfasts were great. The location was initially difficult to find due to a closed bridge.,7.5
Area Is quite and close to all services. Apartment has all needed features including a Nespresso coffee machine. Host Is available to support in city trip info and needs. ,9
The spacious room was all renovated and very clean. Kitchen equipped with all almost the stuff you need (except an oven). Host was very communicative and helpful. He even assisted me showing in a map all activities I could do and also advised on some hidden information like places for a cheap eating historic places which are good or not to visit etc. View from window was acceptable looking from the side Port sea. Perfect heating system. Clean bathroom. Location was 4-5 km walk from the city or several minutes by tram. ,9.6
This location is on the new side of Ostend on the docks. You can reach the town by car. A tip do not drive into town but use the Railway station parking at 15 euro per hour. It is brand new easily accessible and avoids the drive into town. Alternatively take the boat across. The apartment is brand new design parking in front of the door (free). The extra bonus is that this lets you discover the dunes (Fort Napoleon) quiet extensive beach and pure nature of Bredene. At the end of the beach promenade on which you can cycle (free use of 2 bicycles) there is a surfers bar for food and drink. For kids below the Fort Napoleon there is a huge playground in the sand the biggest I have ever seen. ,10
Beautifully furnished warm and spotlessly clean.   In the peaceful fishing harbour - the other end of which is being developed with several blocks of luxury apartments and a couple of swish restaurants.  About 15 minutes walk to the (free) shuttle boat going to the Ostend side of the harbour and about 20 minutes walk to a long beautiful and empty beach (Bredene).  Supermarkets (Carrefour/Lidl) are a short drive or about 15 minutes walk.  Free and easy parking - we didnt need to use the car for our entire stay. Helpful owner provided maps and tips. Nothing,10
The location of apartment was perfect for the city beach and restaurant (2) apartment is clean and equipped with everything you need  wifi is fast & free parking (enough space) nihil,10
Great communication very comfortable place and very convenient location for us. ,10
This is a fabulous apartment in a superb location. Accommodation is clean spacious bright and equipped with everything you need and its super close to lovely bars and restaurants the free ferry to Oostend and exceptional beaches. Owner was incredibly helpful too changing his work schedule to allow us to arrive early. Really wish we had stayed here for longer and cant believe we have overlooked Oostend in the past. Would definitely stay here again.  Everything was perfect!,10
Didnt have the opportunity to stay long this hotel as we checked in quite late and had to leave early due to travel plans.  Check in was easy and the person on the desk was very helpful.  My room was excellent it appears the hotel is in the process of refurbishment.  Breakfast was very good great selection.  Parking was a little tight due to the building and the vehicle size we were travelling in.  Would definitely recommend a stay here and would return when back in Leuven. ,8
Tge hotel is an a good relaxing location with a very beautiful outside garden to use. The staff are great. Rooms are very clean and comfortable with a fair space. I love it. I wasnt my first time in this hotel and it will not be the last. Nothing.,9.2
Loved all of it. Great stuff and facilities. Amazing breakfast ,10
Right next to the UNESCO site and the university faculty club. Very peaceful stay. I enjoyed it a lot. Should stop using paper and plastic cups.,8
Very comfortable and charming atmosphere ,9.6
Friendly staff and wonderful and quite place to stay. Nothing. All good,10
They took care off a small package which had to be kept freezed without a hesitation. Beautiful garden terrace. ,9.2
This is a beautiful location with gorgeous gardens and easy walking access to the centre of town. The staff were very friendly and welcoming - genuinely pleasant to talk with and very helpful. The bed was very comfortable and the room nice and quiet. While our room was a good size and the whole suite definitely adequate it just seemed a little tired and in need of an update. The wifi connection was weak but functional. For the price one would expect a little more.,8
Friendly and helpful staff nice bar and restaurant with good food. 15 min walk from the city centre and a bus stop to Gasthuisberg Central station just in front The room needs a makeover and if Im not mistaking there are already plans to do that.,7.1
The bed! It was so comfortable as was the bedding. The Begijnhof is also exceptionally beautiful. The bar service was a little slow.,8.8
location friendly and very helpful staff ambience It would have been nice to have the bar open on Christmas day but I quite understand why it wasnt,9
It was a lovely hotel. Location was perfect. Great atmosphere and lovely beer. Bathrooms were very clean and lots of towels if needed.  Wonderfully relaxing place beautiful garden.  Very clean. Polite and very helpful staff. I would have liked fresh bread for breakfast some days it did not seem fresh. Not so much selection if arrived for breakfast later rather than early. Room decor was dated (brown and dark).,9.2
The property was gorgeous very quiet and green surroundings. The wifi worked well the bed was comfortable. The room was functional and clean but very basic and small for the ridiculously high price.,7.5
The location is great The room was stark the walls thin,6.7
Very impressed.  Sunnny positive reception staff made us feel very welcome. Loved our room  relaxing garden for a late drink. Leuven was amazing. The bathroom and shower was its weakest area compared to everything else.,10
StaffLocationKindness of citizen Some noise come from other rooms,9.6
Good location Parking coffee pods in room. Comfortable bed. Good shower. room decor a little dated breakfast extra and quite expensive.,8.3
The room. It was really modern and high tech. Very nice! The sheets did smell a bit.,9
The hotel has got a beautiful garden it is clean is located in a very quite area and it is close to the center. There is no door at the shower and no space at all in the room.,8.8
Rooms are still quiet ok and have everything they should have.. start to be a bit outdated mais renovation should start soon Already staid a lot.. still my preferred hotel.  Quiet great staff  top breakfast,8
Lovely hotel - quiet clean and very comfortable. The garden is a beautiful peaceful place to have a drink or coffee. Its only a short walk into the centre of Leuven with is fantastic architecture and lively bars and cafes. Theres plenty of free parking on site and the breakfast is good although a little expensive. The shower isnt very powerful,9.2
The hotel was spotless the staff extremely helpful and the room was very comfortable. The location is great. Easy walk to town and set in a very historic area.  Breakfast was excellent and the hotel made extra effort to provide food etc for my wife who is vegan. Parking also very easy and reasonable. ,10
This is a very nice hotel situated a 10 minute walk south of the town centre.  As a 4 star hotel the price was not too bad.  Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable.  I would return here the next time I visit. ,10
Beautiful setting amazing dining room for breakfast which is a converted coach house. Medieval buildings all around. Just stunning.  ,10
 Some small self cooking possibilities like warming milk at nite for children,9.6
Location was excellent  close to the center and still extremely quiet and it a very clean and modern hotel. There is a good bar and the garden is beautiful. The staff cannot be considered as super helpful one time we were not served at the bar and left while we were the only guests in the bar and the hotel is a bit boring there is not much going on.  Strange that you have to pay for parking and usage of the sauna. The breakfast is low in value for money.,6
Location by the university was fine. Rooms look a little tired and could use a paint job or redecoration to a more modern standard. Far and away the best thing was the restaurant Cum Laude which has changed hands in the last 6 months. We had a memorable meal with excellent service and matching prices Bathroom is a little outdated,7.9
We loved communication with the staff members! They were so helpful and nice. Thank you! Everything was great!,10
Beautiful hotel and gardens. Excellent location with clean rooms and friendly staff. ,10
 The freshness and quality of the small dishes in the bar. It needs a bit of vegetables or salad.,10
Breakfast was awesome - nice coffee machine great pastries.     Every day I cut a slice of a wonderful loaf of bread  and put some smoked salmon on it.    Looked forward to breakfast each day Also.. the renovated rooms are beautifully designed. Shower area was very nice   but there was not little shelf to put soap and shampoo on.    I had to pick them up off the floor.     I am guessing that this detail will eventually be completed.,9
Great Breakfast Room was a bit oldish and worn out. Currently construction works. But we were compensated by free parking.,8.3
Size of the room was great. As was location food and view. The room is starting to look a bit old and tatty - needs a refresh re-paint.  Room was also over priced.,7.1
close to centre well maintained comfortable No restaurant - I gather there has been a court case brought by the University to stop competition from their own restaurant next door - which was of course shut during our stay,10
The breakfast was in a pretty room with access to the garden. The hotel has its own private parking. It takes 25 minutes to walk to the railway station. The room furniture and equipment seemed very old and dark. The rooms have keys (no key cards) so its not practical to carry the key when you go outside (but you can leave it at the reception).,5.4
Quiet neighborhood great location and staff. Breakfast is good! ,10
Well placed for visiting the town.  Very clean and comfortable.  Great coffee and tea machine. ,10
Nice location good clean room very friendly helpful and informative staff. Comfortable stay over a weekend. Thank you! Small windows so can feel a bit closed in.,8.8
In the City center but yet very quiet. room price is good but high price for breakfast & parking.,8.3
Very pleasant decor and surroundings . Modern clean and attractive. Not keen on the sink in the middle of the room. No mirror for doing make up etc and no privacy for shower if sharing a room .,7.9
Friendly staff and beautiful room. Very close to the city center and next to the beguinage. Easy accessible by car and 24hour reception. The hotel had everything we were hoping for. The mattress was hard some people will prefer this. We would rather have soft or medium.,10
Beautiful hotel felt like we were in the country . breakfast was awesome and the room was even better than expected . staff were also so helpful ,10
Rooms are clean and spacy. We got an extra bike rental - a great idea remembering the hotels park location. The lobby bar keeps amontillado jerez on stock. The 19 meter pool is very good. The receptionists were just polite enough  but not at all friendly - strange for a five star hotel. The air conditioning made too much noise - we had to turn it off for the night (and the hotel kindly asks you to keep the windows closed due to bothering insects from the surrounding park). And I somewhat did not like the smell in the bathroom - nothing really bad but not fresh enough either,7.1
Im not sure location and design  Security approach to my girl friend without respect when she lost in this huge facility building hotel it self very butifull but she afraid to walk after that around the facility because of security behaviour and because of that we even left 10 hours earlier. (Dear booking.com in top of that hotel sent me discount rate to acquire me next time directly outside booking.com just come directly get cheaper price),6.7
Everything was great Unfortunately due Covid all amenities is time shortened it was really inconvenient to keep up with it. ,9
Top quality Hotel beatiful and cleaned room the staff is kind and efficient prepared at the height of a beautiful Hotel like this ,10
Very comfortable place and faciloties. The size of the bed . Green all around. Very quite. SPA. Need some walking to get somewhere.,10
Still best choice in Minsk. Reception stuff could behave better - more polite. Why not smile never?  Could be better and more fresh food in chineese restaurant.,8
The rooms are nicely done and very comfortable to stay in. The sleep quality was excellent. I did not try the food but the restaurant looked quite nice and if I had to guess I would say the food would match. Everything about the hotel was ,10
Room size- one of the biggest what you will find in Minsk. Good location. Good SPA area. Payment- attention to other travelers!!! Conformation received from booking.com you get in USD!!! On arrival when you make check in personal says you must pay in BY Rubles and then the funny thing is that they have their own exchange rate and you end up paying extra when you look on your bank account. No complain if would receive conformation in BY rubles or explanation in conformation that you will need to pay in BY Rubles but this small thing disappoint the impression about honesty of hotel.,7.5
Very modern design unlike most hotels in Minsk Staff are extremely welcoming and helpful especially the one on the reception (I couldnt read their name tags).  ,8.3
The swimming pool and the SPA The View from my room,8.3
staff lobby bar had to wait till been served. Staff didnt come to ask for a drink until waived the hand.,9.6
very good breakfast amazing room there was a separation between men and women at the spa. i have been told because its a Chinese hotel. but i was a lot of times in China and there there is no separation,8.8
This place is really what it says it is. You book you pay you enjoy. Its as simple as that! Good food fantastic staff extremely helpful and kind. The location is actually really good its not in the busy centre which I actually liked about it. But having said that it isnt far from the main high street walking distance I would say. Due to pandemic of COVID 19 there were very few people in the hotel which I kinda liked too :) All and all great experience! Enjoy )  ,9
The room is very comfortable (very similar for 5* hotels in China). Staff - very helpful Ive got very quick responses from them for all my questions. Location - that is only 5* hotel in that district (not far from main industrial area) very pleasant n Chinese restaurant in the hotel and breakfast. Both - below my expectations and only because of food. Meals quality is average (If youve ever been in China - not comparable) low value for money you have to pay.   Small parking for guests.,8.8
Beijing Hotel located in a park area. Everywhere is green. Beijing Hotel is very nice. BUT house keeping is not good. First day you receive very nice room. SECOND day and next days  they dont clean room dont take garbage dont clean dust dont put soap.. i asked 3 times to clean room. They dont clean.,2.9
This is a complete package for those who on a business or a romantic trip. Its quiet the staff 5star level trading to the T. Very helpful and always nice. Rooms are spacious and has everything you would expect to have in a hotel room of a 5star hotel.  ,10
 1. The room and bath were not clean  2 hotel charging with American dollars and obligat to pay with rubals according to Hotel rate which is 5% more,6.7
Really great breakfast! Very clean hotel! ,9.2
The building and the restaurant are nice. Noisy room. Not clear air conditioning. Some mosquitos inside the room. Awful cocktails at the bar.,5.4
 The shrimps in the restaurant were with guts.,9
Excellent breakfast and stable Wi-Fi. Strange lighting switches scheme. Only parks near the residence no shops or restaurants in walking distance.,8.8
Excellent location to be in the city and quickly on the beach. Top staff and management team extremely flexible and helpful with a friendly personal touch. Great breakfast and very stylish rooms. The restaurant also offers excellent quality and each menu was of excellent taste. 1a * - we will come back. ,10
- Great bed and linen!!! Very comfy!  - Beautiful restaurant! ,8.3
Very fine design touch and perfect advice for restaurants ,10
Amazing experience in this b&b. Very nice location top quality hospitality and very comfy rooms. The friendly host also own the restaurant and brings fabulous dishes to your room. Personal dinner in style. Bonus is the tasty breakfast the next morning. We will definitely come back! ,10
cool restaurant excellent cook great food nice staff There is none.,10
Very friendly hosts. Spacious comfortable rooms decorated with good taste very good beds. Delicious breakfast. Noice in the street.,8.8
Fabulous location close to the seaside centre of town great artsy design interior just above the restaurant which has a great design delicious menu nice atmosphere. Combination of dining and sleeping is a real treat. Hosts are very friendly fun down to earth helpful. I travel a lot all over the world for work this is one of my favourite places. ,10
Large and clean rooms. Had a view of the Parc Cinquantennaire from the room. All required toiletries were provided including things like  sewing kit bathing caps makeup removal products shoe polish etc. Sauna was well equipped clean and private. Hotel is not in a noisy area and close to the metro and Parc Cinquantennaire and good restaurants nearby  The safe in the room was very small. Could have had more plug points near the bed to allow for phones to charge nearby,9.6
 At check-in they requested my ID-card and they forgot to give it back to me. Even at checkout they did not give it back it was only because I was an other hotel the night after and I realised that my ID-card was gone ..  At check-in they did not tell me that breakfast was NOT included. If I had known I would not have taken breakfast. Because at checkin I had to pay for it. Unnecessary. Bad communication at check-in.,7
The interior was excellent and the location was super! ,8
Excellent location and very comfortable beds. Beautiful hotel.  ,9
Service. Location. Comfy matrass and pillows (you can choose softer or harder one or simply use both). Tea/coffee station in the room.  The furniture and the carpet is a bit old. Strong smell of cigarettes from time to time.,9.2
Good location near the parc cinquantannaire Bed uncomfortable Tacky decoration ,4
Friendly and kind staff. Perfectly located very close to metro station. Small bed in the single room,10
Location is good the staff was nice Room facilities are not very good I had an executive room but it doesnt meet my expectations the bathroom is too small there is no place to put your clothes the pictures in booking .com does not look like the reality and more than that breakfast is poor,6
Friendly staff location (close to park thats especially excellent start for early morning runners) Teh hotel is a bit worn out else ok.,8
Superb location. Only a few minute walk from the Metro station. Very quiet relaxing atmosphere. So much better than the hotels in the EU Quarter. Personally I dont like plastic cups in the bathroom and the soap dispenser was rather hard to manipulate.,9
breakfast was expensive great location for business no bar to relax but very expensive,8
Spacious room and comfortable bed very nice breakfast easy parking of the car nice restaurants in walking distance  ,10
The garden The pillows were so awful.  One was way too big.  The other was way too hard.  Terrible sleep quality.,5.8
nice location big rooms near to my conference ,8
Great place to stay in Brussels on reasonable budget. Metro and shops are in walking distance next to nice park and couple of museums. Quiet location during night friendly personnel. ,9
Nice place. Nice location Staff part time,7
great location for my purpose outdated venue ,4.6
The building and patio its amazing! Super old building feeling. Fancy All good!,10
Good size for a single room. Very quiet even though the hotel was fully booked. Very close to the metro station. Nice view from the window. Kettle +coffee and tea provided (but weird creamer thing instead of milk). The bathroom had a bathtub which is always a plus. Free wi-fi. Free bottle of water on first day. Very small bed and even smaller quilt so I didnt get proper sleep. I booked the best western specifically because I remembered their huge double beds (at least in the US) but the bed in my room was so small i could barely fit and I am not a big woman. Also the quilt was quite small and every time I moved a part of my body was left exposed. Finally I am not a big fan of carpet it always feels like its not that cleanand there was a big ruined spot by the bathroom.,7
Great location kind staff (the one person who was there) beautiful garden. Shut down everything for Covid. I do understand but Booking and website should flag and even then the hotel should at least provide a small kettle in room and provide pro active information to travelers as to how to find something to eat. Decor a bit dated but fine.,7
The location garden and quietness The room was Very warm and dry air. But it was a warm day.,7
They have a sauna which can be heated on request. Close to Merode metro. Quiet and spacious rooms. ,8.8
Comfortable room good lighting strong WiFi good location (near restaurants subway park supermarket etc.). Good breakfast as well.  I have stayed here previously--its comfortable easy and fantastic metro access (and walking distance to European Commission headquarters). The room was a bit hard to control the temperature (a common winter problem).,9
As it was during lockdown there were no facilities open and nobody even at the reception desk. We had to ring to enter the hotel.  The receptionist appeared in gym kit and socks with no shoes on.  We checked in for four (prepaid nights).  But the next night our cards didnt work and the same underdressed receptionist appeared.  He reset our cards but nevertheless they still didnt work on the third night.  This time a different more efficient receptionist did the job.  One day our room wasnt cleaned although we were out from 9am until 6pm,5
Nice breakfast. Quiet room. Close to institutions. ,8
Comfortable clean friendly service Location very quiet,8.3
No breakfast available due to Covid.  Hotel location excellent. Radiators could not be adjusted.  The one at the window was stuck on and the one in the bathroom was stuck off.  So we opened the window.  We did not complain we accept it may be difficult to get things fixed due to Covid.,8
The hotel was close to the Merode metro station and the Cinquantenaire park. It is located in a nice area. I felt safe walking home at night. The staff were all lovely. ,10
Friendly Staff Clean room with comfortable bed. ,10
Very spacious and clean. Perfect location for our needs. The pillows were too big,10
Delicious breakfast and I liked the ability to press orange juice ,9
Pleasant district good localities. You should take care because the wole payment was blocked at your account by the booking.,8.8
 Our car parked in front of the hotel however the reverse mirror of our car was destroyed !!!,6.3
 Staff formal and not flexible. Cancellation one day before arrival resulted in 100% payment for two days. Not only for first night but for total stay,2.5
Friendly staffNice roomGreat breakfast ,8
Lovely place 5 minutes walk into the centre. Clean easy to locate and Jimmy (host) is a great man chatty and very happy to help Nothing,10
Breakfast was very good and fit for a day on a bike. Nice decoration. Bedroom is spacious. Host rents good bikes and knows a lot about biking tours. ,9
Walking distance to Grote market and Cloth Hall. B&B is located on the third level accessed by a narrow staircase so our heavy suitcases stayed downstairs in the main house. We were given the keys and due to host working we were given free reign and didnt actually meet. But a friend warmly greeted us in his behalf and kindly prepared breakfast for us before she left for work which was delicious! Lived the eclectic collection of vintage items and the room was tastefully decorated with plenty of tourist brochures available.  Stated that parking was available nearby which was actually street parking around the corner but the host kindly allowed us to use his local parking permit.,9.2
Very comfortable beds excellent continental breakfast. The host gave us a very warm welcome and was very helpful throughout our stay ,10
Very friendly host beautiful property and lovely breakfast. ,9.6
Well presented and furnished Open plan bathroom,9.6
Jimmys welcome and friendliness during our stay was excellent.  The guest room is very well appointed in a unique quirky way. ,8.8
Very comfortable beds. Well furnished and equipped nice garden.  Good location. Plenty of information regarding things to see and do. Helpful host. Very bright sensor light just outside bedroom door- not good in middle of the night!,10
Very clean and well equipped great location- easy walk to city centreLots of room for family to spread out comfortably  Nothing,10
Location The furnishing was excellent. They had thought if everything. Very high spec good quality everything. Loved the wall paper in toilets. Beds comfy warm excellent equipped kitchen. Tv great choice with BBC and Netflix. Garden even had heater. Could walk to everywhere.  ,10
Clean modern and spacious bakery and butcher just across the road and a small supermarket close by short walk to the centre  The downstairs toilet needs a bit of a clean when we arrived otherwise was perfect. ,9.6
The house was super comfortabel and a nice place to enjoy a trip with friends! ,9.6
We had an amazing stay in Bruges - helped hugely by Landers lovely apartment. Location was great just a short walk into the centre but with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Very spacious and modern all rooms were immaculate and the Christmas decorations were a lovely touch!  ,10
Excellent townhouse where everything was clan comfortable and made in really high quality. We loved the outside space and the lovely bathrooms - one of them on suite. nothing,9.2
The location is great and the property itself is amazing. Close walk to the sites and very quiet neighborhood. Lander is an exceptional host and provides great information about the city and region. ,10
Ee would give this flat 10 with 5 plusses. The house is amazing with great technique equipment beds and everything of a good quality. The host knows how to please the guests. We enjoyed stay so much. Location is also perfect We liked absolutely everything,10
I loved everything about this house.  The host was great and met us and provided lots of information.  The kitchen is very well stocked.  He even left a few beers for us to drink!  There was plenty of space for our family and all beds are comfortable.  It is nicely decorated and very clean.  Would love to return. ,10
We liked everything! Newly renovated house on three floors big and well-furnished kitchen 2 bathrooms and one toilette. Great value for money! Perfect location 10 min walk from train station and city centre. Quiet place supermarket just around the corner. Perfectly clean house confortable beds. Love it! -,10
Being able to eat breakfast on the patio Very small thing - Living room needs a bit of art on walls to make it less clinical,9.6
it was spacious very very clean. kitchen had everything we needed pots and pans to tea and coffee. used the four hr parking card outside when we first got there later parked in the station car park for 2 days which costed us around 32 euros. was a 14 min walk back ,9.6
Excellent decor Great location Friendly owner. ,10
Location Room was a bit small especially the bathroom but I was there for 1 night only so I understand they did not give me their largest room.,8.8
Such a friendly reception - was like being with old friends! Nothing!,10
This is a truly remarkable place. The hosts are welcoming and friendly every detail in this cosy old house is beautifully designed and crafted and the breakfast‚Äîas mentioned by other reviewers before me‚Äîis just perfect so it has been a pleasure staying there. I do not tend to write enthusiastic reviews but I find this hotel exceptional. -,10
A real pleasure to stay in such a cosy beautiful little hotel tucked up a side street in Hasselt.  Lovely owners helpful and friendly.  Comfortable room great breakfast.  Highly recommended. ,9
Very friendly welcome B&B with lots of character and excellent amenities. Quiet area of Hasselt everything within walking distance. Excellent breakfast! Nothing,10
Beautiful spacious room and very cosy with gorgeous big sofa natural feel with all wood and cotton. Excellent breakfast. Would definitely go again  ,9
I loved the cosy rustic vibe with the amazing terrace the excellent breakfast and the amazing bedrooms!  Was a great stay and thank you very much for all the help provided.  We will definitely come back! nothing really to commend here!,10
This hotel with a friendly staff is located in downtown Hasselt just around the corner of the cathedral. It offers a clean (bath)room a soft bed and a breakfast buffet in the morning. Good value for money. Recommended! ,9
Atmosphere was excellent breakfast was excellent and sumptuous ,9
Friendly staff Nice room good beds great breakfast very central.  ,9.6
This place is a treat. My room was large tastefully decorated and more than comfortable. We took extra time for breakfast as there are so many delicious items to taste from. Parking was close to the property and easy to find for me. I was here for work but would love to come back with my partner for a weekend.  ,10
Lovely little hotel right in centre of Hasselt. Friendly staff and nice breakfast There was nothing I didnt like!,10
Beautiful interior charming hosts excellent breakfast top location individual and original ,10
Cosy. Calm. Clean. Many interior design ideas. Wonderful use of wood (wooden floor stair bathroom) Quiet. But in city centre Friendly. Very nice quality breakfast buffet. Eggs a la carte. No coffee machine in the room for my husband in the morning.,8
Self check-inClean (bath-)roomSome refreshments were preparedCute balcony  -,10
Thanks for hosting me Joon You are running a charming and well executed estabblishment the room was perfect specially bed large screen fats wifi and large shower were nice :) ,10
The rooms looks very new & modern and were equipped with a luxury bathroom with great rain shower.  Plus points for having a microwave and a fridge in the room. Also the WIFI connection was easy and fast. Great location and rooms for this price !!!! Perfect if you planned to have dinner in Leuven and decide to go for one or several cocktails afterwards! We will come back in the future for sure! No breakfast but was mentioned on booking.com and there is a bakery nearby.,10
Very cosy and clean stay. I will definitely recommend this place. Parking was around the corner and not expensive at all. Thanks Joon! ,10
Was there for one night but everything was clean and comfortable. Contactless checkin was very straight forward. Would definitely stay again. ,9
Wonderful communication - great location amenities and lovely vibe well stay there again! ,10
Good sized comfortable room spotlessly clean and the cutest little balcony. No breakfast is available (as stated) but there is coffee making facilities a fridge and a microwave in the room and there are plenty of cafes nearby too. Good communication with the host. You have to go up a steep narrow staircase to get to the room (no lift). We struggled a little with the luggage. Not really a complaint but something to be aware of for people with less mobility.,10
I liked it was cosy and nice and bath was clean. There was microwave and other facilities such ironing freezer etc. The sheet of the bed and the pillows were smelling,8
The hotel is ideal for latecomers - walking distance from the train station and self check-in. Most of the hotels and B&Bs do not accept guest arriving after 22-00. Room is spacious enough clean and cozy I found everything I needed and even more than you can get in a big hotel. Excellent value for money. ,9
Great location excellent value super easy self-check in ,9
This place had very comfortable bed amazing shower nice space with a table to have breakfast nespresso machine and TV with a lot of channels in English. Spotless clean with spacious bathroom. Cleaning service every day. Perfect location in the center for shopping restaurant M museum and also train station is easy walking distance! Easy self check in and good communication from the host. ,9
Everything was great loved the amenities and felt like the owner put a lot of thought into making guests feel like at home. ,9
Swift and open communication with the host cleanliness as well as quality/price ratio. Good location too. Would stay again. Some weirdness with the internet connection stability and safety (got some red flags from connection security apps) throughout the stay which can be bothersome to people travelling on business. But as far as I understood it was a general problem all across Leuven with this internet provider during the days of my stay. Hopefully it is true.,9
Very easy and modern small scale hotel featuring three rooms. Contact per WhatsApp was very easy and agreeable nice equipment and style of furniture. A big plus is the rain shower which was amazing and the complimentary coffee and tea. Also hand sanitizer was provided in the entry which was nice to conform to corona rules! Nothing! If anything I didnt like the cushions but everyone feels different about those!,10
The room was very nice and well located.Due to current covid prevention measures all the information about our stay was provided by message through booking but everything was perfectly explained and prepared and above all very safe! Joon was very helpful and attentive. Id totally recommend this place and Ill go back next time I travel to Leuven! ,10
Everything was great! A warm welcome with a bottle of wine coffee capsules tea chocolate and water bottles was waiting on the table which really made my stay much better as I needed a lot of coffee before I left my room! The bathroom was large and clean and a lot of attention has been paid to include toiletries that one might need. everything was great!,9.6
- location in walking distance to train station and centre- nice house with 2 rooms - comfortable bed if anything staircase is a bit narrow which complicates lifting your suitcase a bit,9
Amazing shower There wasnt enough toilet paper,10
Great host quick communication apartment well equipped with all you need and very cosy. Located 5 min walk from city centre - brilliant.  Nothing,10
Very cosy hotel only a few rooms so you feel at home.  The staff was very helpful and the room was very clean.  Everything was corona proof. The bathroom was modern and clean.  Right in the centre but still very quiet. We had heard no noise at all although its a student city. ,10
Big comfortable bad a lot of space warm heaters large bathroom perfect cleaning service every day new towels shampoo shower gel. Location is quite comfortable near the city center and railway station several shops and no noise at night. Everything is amazing people who own the room are very friendly and helpful.Positive experience should stay there in case of next visits! ,10
The room had everything I needed and how it was advertised. There were no net on big window looking directly on ground level street.Curtains were quite light concerning the size of windowI had to be careful not to be seen by people on the street.,7.5
Close to the train station No housekeeping. No eateries in and around the place. Key collection is a major hassle. Very late check in time of 4 PM,5.4
 Cleanliness needs to be upgraded it had spiders web all across room on roof,5
Good Hotel especially location wise extra charges if you check in early,7.5
The location The bloody spiders and spiderwebs,6.3
 one of 4 beds was totally broken we had to repair it ourselves to be able to sleep corretly. Spiders available. TV only german channels no belgian. And if after all that you calculate a 75/10 Booking.com notes very high then.,7.5
Friendly staff. Terrible lighting - couldnt see a thing!!!! Would not go back for this reason alone.,7.5
There was a well equipped kitchen with refrigerator microwave electric cooktops utensils. Good heating. There was an electric iron with an ironing table television good furniture. Very clean and comfortable. Daily cleaning entails a daily charge of 12 euros. A bottle of water could have been provided as the nearest supermarket was 10min walk away and all shops in the area close at 6pm. No soap or shampoo either. Couldve used these after a tiring journey. A microwave safe bowl would have been useful. A few chairs in the reception would have been helpful as I had to wait for almost at hour to check in. Even though my check in time was 4pm had to wait till 5pm in the cold weather for the office to open.,7.1
Breakfast and the garden The bed and the wall around the bed,6.7
Garden was good Feels very insecure there not clean rooms no one in the reception very bad smell in the rooms. I made an early check out as the rooms were bad and mostly because of security issue but they did not return my money. The cost does not comply with services at all. not recommended place.,1
The location of the place is just perfect. City is very easier to accesses to. The staff speaks good English and are willing to help. The collection of keys is easier. Cleaniness could have been better Breakfast offering was not good. It lacked the variety It was really expensive. Wifi speeds are not that great. Some days it didnt even work,5.4
Situated close to parking and city center ,6.7
 No shampoo shower gel slippers and cleaning service.,7.1
the place was newly redecorated. It looks great. ,10
Great hotel at top location. Lots of parking possibilities and beach right behind hotel. Room was perfect for our stay and special requests very well handled by staff. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever seen. Conclusion value for not so much money! We live in crazy times during the Corona pandemic and staff needs to maintain all safety matters for our health. It seemed the breakfast procedure was understaffed. All respect and thanks to the man in charge Geert who kept it all going on.,9
Breakfast was tremendous. We had little misunderstanding between staff but they were taking quick action to fixed that. The room was perfect clean equiped very well. materials in the room tea coffee etc. was in a good quality. I would stay again there for my next travel.I love the way how they decorated the hotel and room. ,10
great location very clean rooms great breakfast ,9
Location was very good  Rooms very nice and clean Good facilities. The pillows were a bit strange and not very comfortable A more traditional type of pillow would be a nice option to have.,8
The location of this place is very convenient - its almost on the seaside. If you need parking I would recommend taking Indigo - Parking Zeedijk - its located just over the corner (though the price for 1 day there is 25 EUR - the same as Indigo Kursaal / Centrumparking which is overpriced from my point of view). The staff in the hotel was very friendly (both - at reception and in the dining area). Anti-coronavirus measures are everywhere and when I entered my room there was a huge bottle of sanitizer on the table. The room was clean quite cozy with a kettle coffee machine and a mini-fridge. That was a very comfortable stay and I can surely recommend this hotel to everyone. I have nothing to complain on because everything was great!,10
The staff was really nice and kind. The room was really nice decorated. The breakfast was adjusted very smart considering the Corona virus. The mattress cover kept sliding down,10
I had an amazing stay the place was spotless and cosy. Great and complete breakfast.Staff super nice and friendly. Great location! Sad that the spa was closed because corona.,9
The breakfast is really good plenty of options. Just the croissant was not fresh so I skipped it. The bed is amazing comfortable  and the room is nicely decorated. ,10
Very good location very good breakfast and staff was very nice and helpful! Everything was very good!  Nothing,9
Good location comfortable beds clean rooms and nice interior. The room and bathroom layout was not super practical. For example when you open the door you directly walk into the side of the closet and in the bathroom there is not enough place to put cosmetics and shower products.What was really disappointing is that the hotel closes at 10pm and there is no receptionist till early morning. You can enter the hotel with the room card but the first night of our stay it broke down (the system to swipe the card) and we could not enter the hotel with other guests for almost an hour. Even more disappointing is the fact that we did not receive any apology from the management which is unacceptable for a 4 starts hotel.,8
Proper COVID measures without too much inconvenience. Breakfast system (pick up food from buffet table and bring to your room on a tray) works super well! ,9
Clean and cozy room. The breakfast was amazing. Nice and proffesional staff. For a growing businessyou cant go wrong with this kind of employees. I will come back again for sure.The wifi is included and strong. ,10
Very nice hotel in good position close to the sea and centre of city. Lack of restaurant.Only breakfast are served.,9
Comfy bed spacious shower and the location was amazing. Close to beach but also to bars restaurants and shops The ac is a little loud but thats not the hotels fault,9
Great place! Amazing space and wonderful location ,10
A very nice and stylish apartment the location is amazing. The communication with the manager Camille was perfect. the smell of the vegan cafe ..,9
The location is great. Nobody to inform you at the arrival how to get in !! (Hopefully I Found the managers phone on the website so after 5 calls and 2 messages I could be in touch with her to have to codes to get in). The appartement is nice but without any basical accessorize (no handsoap !! that is absurd even for the cheapest hotels). Apparently previous guests already made this remark but the host negliged these details. Very upsetting. ,5
The builiding is beside the river and very good location in the historic city centre. 2 minutes walke to Tram 1/2 station which connected with Gent Sint Pieters station directly. The space is high and spacious with good decorated nice host. ,9.2
Very nice apartment just next to our conference building. Excellent location for sightseeing and nice walks along the river. ,8.8
Great location and spacious clean apartment. Wifi didnt work so well around the house,10
The A/C in the bedrooms was most welcome during the heat wave. ,9.6
 No hooks in the bathroom to hang up towels whilst taking a shower,7.9
Location design and lay-out. Heating was dysfunctional. Dishes were not clean. Light bulbs defective.,5
The central location is great. Our host Camille was very quick to respond to any requests. Apartment is well heated and spacious. Great place to use as a base. Was missing a few simple things. Iron and ironing board but Camille did organise one from the other apartment. Buy another one guys! Blind in the back room needs a bit of attention (strings are just tangled which is typical of those blinds so couldnt get it down) but wasnt a big deal.,8.8
The apartment is in excellent location. Spacious and bright. Communication was poor. For several weeks we did not get a confirmation as to which apartment we actually booked. This was irrespective of repeated messages and even a phone call. The answer came on the day of arrival. We had to ask for check-in instructions several times as well. Two towels were dirty. There was no soap by the sink in the bathroom so we used the shower gel from the shower. No kitchen towel. One bulb cover needs fixed in the bathroom and lots of empty nails on the walls. Despite that we found everything else we needed and had a good stay.,8
very nice owner.! showed me where I should park privately.  patiently and friendly! more than nice apartment luxury!if I be back in gent again I will book by Camille again! ,10
Location No Iron and Ironing Board when requested still did not delivered. Arrived late no water or some small welcome amenity milk and tea should be available small quantity for the first night some lights not working also.,4.5
Location. Design. Space.  Camille is amazingly friendly and helpful Owen ,10
 I didnt like that we had to park our car so far away.,7.5
Swimming pool is amazing. Better at night as pools are outside in some cases. Open til 9pm so that was good to fill up the evening. Rooms are adequate for what we need. Cycle routes outside the camp are fantastic. ,9.6
Nothing Everything the staff was rude and racist ,2.5
Very friendly and helpful stuff. Great holidays for parents and children. Aquadrom make you fell like a child again on all the slides.  The house has all the equipments needed next time we will bring more towels on our own. I booked via booking.com because the centerparcs website always showed an error when I wanted to proceed to paying.   With my booking.com reservation number I wasnt able to use the center parcs app to make reservations for activities I always had to book at reception. No big deal but probable easy for the IT guys to fix.,8.8
swimming pool animal enclosures blonde at the reception very unkind and not helpful at all.  At the reception you can buy fire starters made with petroleum (for barbecue use) which causes an awful smell in the air everywhere. Instead start selling or using bio block fire starters without offensive odours.  Very stingy with toilet paper.,5
 Car park so far away when we had to carry big bags every day to car,6.3
Swimming pool was good Childrens play area was good.  Distance from the villa to the centre was great There was a 24hr shop but only stocked beer and snacks. We arrived at 21:00 through no fault of our own (traffic) and we had a child with us. We could have done with some basics for a quick meal - bread milk butter ham/cheese or eggs. Staff were rude Villa didnt have half the beds made and only supplied 2 towels for our family of 4 The Evergreens restaurant all you can eat is way too expensive not to include drinks in the price.,5.4
Accommodation was clean and in a nice setting. Aqua Mondo was great Staff were nice and there were plenty of playgrounds for the kids to use. The food served in the restaurants was quite expensive and not great quality. There also seemed to be a lot of cars on the site which made it difficult to cycle with the kids. We couldnt use any of the booking reference provided to us on the Centre Parcs APP which meant we could not pre book any events bikes etc. This turned out to be quite a negative as a lot of the things on offer such as rock climbing and hiring bikes where fully booked by the time we turned up.,7.5
The location is wonderful and the whole park is very pleasant. Overall it was good value for money. There was no air-conditioning and it was very warm when we visited. Could have been cleaner overall in the cottage. Perhaps nets on the windows would be beneficial to keep insects away.,8.3
Very nice vip room with sauna amazing range of activities indoor and outdoor  The staff seems tired and fed up..,9
swimming pool hotel is very old and not up to modern standards,4.6
Facilities were amazing staff lovely We had a huge leak and ruined kids clothes kids had to sleep in lounge area as smelt for a couples of days. So need to take this further as although was sorted no compensation sorted for the first few days ruined!,5.4
There were so many activities to choose from and the pool was fantastic - the children were in every day. The farm smell outside our lodge. It was a very long walk to get something the children left in the car.,8.3
 The villas were not cleaned daily not well maintained and cheap uncomfortable beds.,2.9
Staff were friendly and helpful Restaurant Fuego and Evergreen were seriously overpriced for what you received,8
Pool is great location/setting is lovely  We were turned away by 2 restaurants as they said they were closed while they were still both half full of peopleWe were thus forced to eat in the restaurant where the entertainment was on. It was way too loud even when sitting in the back. Rooms was very old clean but scruffy because of the fittings,6.3
 Tried to change dates over a month before. Accommodation available but Center Parcs totally inflexible. Booking.com also inflexible. Both companies blaming each other for not being able to change booking. Feel like wed been scammed. Not using either ever again.,1
Amazing facilities and caters for all ages as we had a 7 year old and a 70 year old in our party! The activities were easy to book on the day and the aquamundo and discovery bay were fantastic. The patio area was overgrown and it wasnt particularly pleasant to sit out.,8.8
NIce apartment and outdoor area and close by swimming pool. ,9.6
I liked the location and the access to many different activities. The cottage was also spacious. The staff was very friendly. The water park and discovery park were awesome and my toddler really enjoyed herself. Us parents also enjoyed all the activities. The food at all of the restaurants was not the best. Some of the extra activities were too expensive considering the price that was already paid to stay. The cottage also got very hot on some days and because there are no screens in the windows we could not just leave the windows open to get some air.,7.5
The room was spacious with a balcony to enjoy a coffee in morning overlooking the lake. Spacious double sink bathroom which was very clean. I loved the fact that we had a mini fridge in the room. Close to the swimming pool (market dome) fabulous breakfast with lots to choose from. Even though we had a fridge in the room it did not work properly. So drinks werent kept cold. In my father in laws room the fridge however did work.,9.2
Excellent room with a great bed nice chairs a lovely desk at a window comfy carpeting a great bathroom. Everything extremely clean and well kept. Common living-room extra cozy. Great hosts altogether. The bathroom in our room had a curtain instead of a door. Not a big problem given the size of the bathroom and room but a door would be a bit better.,10
Nice place very nice lady who gives you all info you need .Clean room nice breakfast and coffee.You are in centre of the city practically.I recommend it to all my friends. ,10
Quiet yet very convenient for Bruges centre. Excellent hosts. Nothing,10
This is probably the nicest B&B weve stayed in.  Katrien was a phenomenal host going way out of her way to make sure our stay was truly memorable.  The room was very well appointed very comfortable and everything seemed like it was just built yesterday.  Breakfast was fantastic with a different assortment all three mornings we were there.  The B&B is located about 1 minute from the inbound bus stop and less than 5 min from the outbound bus stop making getting back and forth to the train station simple. Absolutely nothing,10
Spacious clean and comfortable with great staff. Breakfast was very good and the location was quiet. ,10
Experience totally in line with the attractive description ! Stayed for 2 nights with my spouse. We will gladly repeat. Large room huge bathroom & shower. Very quiet neighbourhood abundant street-parking available in front of the door to get the luggage in/out (although expensive to stay parked there - as in all of the inner city - parking on the belt is free and 5-10 min walk) Close enough to historical city-center to walk - far enough to use different ways and to find non-tourist bars and restaurants in the area. Very warm welcome and great breakfast daily prepared & warm buns/croissants. Fresh water/coffe/thee available and trusting (affordable) self-service bar at disposal all day/night. ,9
Beautiful house finished to a high standard and fresh local produce served for breakfast. Katrien is very warm and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic location on the edge of the centre with a lovely 10 minute walk to the main square. ,10
Beautiful apartment with the best hostess! -,10
Katrien is a wonderful host and provided lots of helpful information about Bruges. The breakfast was the best weve had on our 6 week holiday. Would highly recommend Central Bruges B&B.  ,10
Everything. The hotel was beautiful. Modern quirky. In a great location close to everything.  Breakfast was really lovely with such a nice personal touch. Katrien is very welcoming and Was so helpful with lots of recommendations. My only recommendation would be to make the breakfast go on a bit later. Being up and out early is great but its also nice to have a bit more of a lazy morning when youre away on your holidays.  check out would also be better if it was a little later.,10
Appartement house is located very close to the city center of Brugge. 5 min walking. It is located in a quiet neighborhood and the rooms are very clean and well equipped.  Breakfast was good and the host was very attentive and friendly. We had a great stay and would definitely come back. Nothing.,9
Everything was super (location breakfast room)! Katrien is a really nice person. :) Nothing! Maybe for me the mattress was a bit too soft but of course it depends on you :),10
Fantastic variety at breakfast: fruit yoghurt juice eggs homemade bread and pastries. The house was spotless and Katrien helpful and friendly. ,10
Wonderful interior its like taking a pleasant trip back in time.  Great service and friendly host. Very clean.  ,10
Everything was amazing Katrien is an amazing host. We truly felt at home and well cared ,10
Theres a lot of B&B accommodation in Bruges but this is a gem quietly located and beautifully appointed. Super large room great facilities and a lovely breakfast. Easy check in and Katrien could not have been more helpful or accommodating. Some nice touches here and great value for money. Nothing.,10
Amazing host always there to answer our questions. Also we must say breakfast was really good . Would recommend and would go back ! ,10
This experience is truly one of the box.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you feel relaxed and at home.  Katrien is at the heart of it all - a truly lovely person who really cares about her guests.  The breakfasts are just as beautiful as the reviews say.  We chose this accommodation based on the rave reviews and now we see why.  A real gem - thanks so much. Nothing at all.,10
A beautiful home in a quiet area just 15 minutes walk from the city centre. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Katrien was a fantastic host  providing plenty of information on what to do whilst in Bruges and her attention to detail was amazing. The breakfast was awesome too! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone.  Nothing.,10
Comfy beds Big towels Friendliness and helpfulness of Katrien Facilities ,10
The check-in was fast and easy the room was clean and well prepared. The breakfast was with a wide choice tea coffee and fresh fruit available throughout the whole day. Easy to park before the house and free parking available within 10 minutes walk. The city center is very close within 10 min walking distance. The host Tatjana was very helpful and was happy to assist in case of any questions available as well by phone through the whole day. We will definitely come back in Christmas time for another weekend :) ,10
I absolutely loved the location when the central train station is across the street and the center of the city is in a walking distance. People were very friendly and helpful. We needed to sort out a quite complicated issue with the payment for the room (which was about to come from the university) and the manager assisted us with every detail. The wi-fi was actually much better than the last time a few years ago. And this time we also got two bonuses -- a fridge and a scenic view on the city roofs from our bathroom :) The wi-fi access was sort of strange. Many websites were inaccessible. There was no shower handler in the bathroom.,9.6
In general everything is very wrost Rooms very small bed too also very bad WiFi even breakfast very poor,5
I havent had breakfast. A more thorough cleaning and an air freshener wouldnt be wrong.,7.1
Good value for money clean room and clean bathroom lovely breakfast. Perfect location close to Central Station. Nothing.,9
Location was good. Low prices. Easy staff. The towels had stains of make-up from earlier guests. Some rooms did not have a good functioning shower.,4.6
The location is realy good 200m from antwerp central statoin. The bads is really bad good that i stay 1night was hard to sleep.carpet in the corners ir realy dirty and there is no air conditioner had to make the perfect temperutire for your selft.staff ho work there is not so frindy and all the time rude,4.6
location shower door had no seal  towels on carpet outside toilet to dry the carpet so staff knew about problem but door was never fixed.,5.5
Very close to central train station. Walk to restaurants and sightseeing. Good place to stay ,8.8
Very close to train station in diamond district. I loved the main alsquare and the churches and cathedral. I loved the pedestrian street. I loved how easy it was to get around and the lack of traffic and busy roads compared most to Brussels. I liked everything,9
It was very dirty and small we booked for 2 nights and did not stay because there was a lot of staining on the mattress which we think was blood and urine the mirror was missing a large chunk and it was the same in my friends room also the carpets and walls were very dirty and the pillows were stained yellow .health and safety need to check this out Everything It needs to be totally refurbished or closed Its not safe to sleep there Health and safety issues Nothing like their website photos at all .totally misleading,1
The best place coming from the railway station friendly welcome at this time of the year even a choice of the floor (as I prefer to take the staircase) a good breakfast The shower wasnt cleaned!!,9
Location is excellent. Breakfast is decent. Good value for money. The smell of sewers was really obnoxious.,7.5
It was perfectly adequate and offered excellent value for money. Rooms are Clean beds & bathrooms are OK. I was at the rear on a higher floor and it was quiet enough. I would consider staying here again. The rooms are a little small and dark.,7
Big spacious room. Not the cleanest place in Antwerp but still okay. Been there before and would go again. ,7.1
Location is awesome Beds werent comfortable at all. Mattress felt quite hard. Shower was very small and also a bit uncomfortable. No decent small shampoos. Just  a shower + shampoo-in-one plastic pack,6.3
Great location for the station and jewellery shops We had to try three key cards to get into our room on the seventh floor before we were given another room with a key card that worked in the door.,10
Location is superb. Bathroom is very clean. Rooms are old. Carpet surfaces and armchairs are not very clean.,8.8
 It was handy to be near central station but too noisy,3
The location was really nice one minute walk from the train station and not far from city center. The bed was comfortable and the room very comfy and clean. Staff friendly although we didnt have any special requirement or contact with them. The road was busy and the isolation of the room did not allow us to sleep without any noise. I must say that I woke up a couple of times due to this but again no super noisy.,8.3
City location breakfast Street noise no air con,5.8
size cleanliness and location just across from the station. Good if you are on foot with a bag. no tea/coffee or kettle. That would have been a good provision.,8.3
 Extended with one night and the price went up 300%.  For the same room... Almost criminal to ask that much money.,9.2
A fine hotel for one or two nights. Only spent the night there so I couldnt tell something about the restaurant but the rooms were clean and tidy. Nice showers. Close to the center. Didnt like the neighborhood but the hotel cant help that,7.5
 Its a little old but thats the bad only thing. And for the price thats ignorable. ,10
This is a very conveniently located hotel with very friendly staff clean comfortable rooms and a good breakfast My one gripe on the continent - no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms,9.6
Good central location across from railway station Although a good location very noisy outside from  railway station and early morning revellers!,7.9
Awesome hotel with nice location near the center ))) ,10
Location was great just near the station. Good WiFi. Single room was a fair size for a single. Was a large impersonal hotel. Carpets were quite stained and dirty. Restaurant they claimed to be open every night was not on the night I tried to eat there and the night b4 was booked for a group.,7.9
comfy bed great evening meal. can not think of anything you could have done better .,10
Great location but over experience is poor. The furniture was old. There were unscrewed bolts showing from one of the the beds. The bathroom in general was clean except the bathtub which was  unusable. Most surfaces were dusty. A lot of dust in the room in general. The carpet had stains. In a room with 4 beds there were only 2 electric outputs - one of them next to the door. Only one of the four people at the reception actually was helpful. Cleaning lady did not come to clean the room when we put the sign but everyday at about 4pm while our baby was sleeping - so no one cleaned the room for four days though she offered change of towels every time. ,2
The hotel was just across the train station and round the corner from pubs restaurants and shops.  The receptionists were always very helpful with providing information we required to get around Antwerp. The room was warm and the heated bathroom flooring was awesome :) Very clean rooms! We left our luggage in the luggage room until it was time to check in no tags no checking who took what and which.  Not secure at all..,8.3
Amazingly for its tiny size the room had all the essentials (except for a fridge) even a table with 2 chairs. Location is perfect for me - literally right across the central train station. Its a bit noisy with windows open but I am not bothered by that Wifi didnt work at all. I stayed only one night so didnt bother trying to talk with the staff about it. Signal was good but there was no internet - its possible that it could have been fixed by the staff. The room was tiny and there was no fridge. Windows cant be fully opened - only tilted,7.1
Ideal location next to Antwerp Central Station Common areas could do with a lick of paint but my room & shower facilities etc were clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower worked well.  There was a good selection of items included in the buffet breakfast.  The staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful As ever on the continent there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room,9.6
Perfect for price and location! No hairdryer in the room,9
They gave out my booked room to someone else. ,5.8
It is close to the Central station and we could walk to quite a lot of attractions and did not have to make use of public transport.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. I hated the twin beds.  Not the fact that they were separate but the fact that the mattresses are so light and with every turn it would move which meant you spent mos of the night trying to keep the mattress on the base.  The mattress was  also stained and it just did not seem that clean to me.,4
This was  the nastiest hotel I have seen anywhere and for bookings.com to advertise it is pathetic.do you not ever research the properties you advertise on your site? We had four rooms booked for 8 total people and we everyone arrived two of the rooms were so deplorable our friends went next door to the Hampton Inn we kept two rooms but the hotel had the audacity to charge us for all rooms anyway to which I will dispute with my card company. I plan on never using booking.com to book rooms as the standards are less than adequate to say the least! A completely different hotel!,3.8
Nothing Beds were not made and the room was filthy. The maid wanted to argue with us that sheets were clean even though there was hair on them. Disgusting room.,3.8
Good location big beds.  Room wasnt clean when we arrived (rice left of the table and marks in the bathroom. ),5
Location Staff and service! After 01 am they put the light of and they close the doer you have to call via the bell and wait in that could till they open the doer!There must be another way to get in without calling staff! And the next doer in the middle of the night they were making noises I also enjoy the weekend but I feel and respect around me!,5
Location is near the station and shopsonly a few meters away. Very slow wifi connection.im sorry but our room was not so clean or maybe it is because the hotel is old alreadysame age as the room carpet and the smell of our room is not that pleasant.good that we only stayed there for only a night.,5
I Very clean room. Location was great. Very good price The hotel was the bare minimum. Not beautifully designed no bath tab and no great view.,6
Very central good value for price. Clean and tidy. Unpleasant wake up from loud tourist in the corridor before 7AM then again when cleaner came. ,8.8
My room was a fair size the bathroom perfectly reasonable the bed was comfortable good choice of lighting options in the room and a view over the rooftops of old Antwerp. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is perfect just next to Central station. No tea / coffee making facilities in the room no air con slow lifts. But despite the few shortcomings you get more than you pay for here.,8
I like the location I dont like smart stuff,5
Location is perfect!  5 min walk from the railway station. Touristic bus stop on the square near the railway station Many shops in the area. At about 10 min walk from the hotel is the excellent Argentinian bistro where we had dinner every day. It was terrible hot in the hotel No Air Conditioner. You cannot open the window. I had problems with Internet and have to go to a cafeteria at the Railway Station to use the WiFi there. In the bathroom there was no one shelf no one hook to carry the towel.,5.4
very friendly staff great location and very clean the road works when trying to get into the car park,10
The location is good in front of the train station.The breakfast is Ok I didnt like the breakfast room .  It is an old hotel,5.4
Excellent hotel located right across the train station and great value for money with excellent staff that always help when needed. WiFi was very poor and sometimes cutoff.,9.6
I liked the fact that its very close to the Station. Could have had air-conditioning in the room. I was sweating like the Niagara Falls in the bed.,7.5
Hotel is one minut from Antwerp centraal station which is great. Near by centar good option for those who wants to travel to the other cities like Brugge Gant. Room was really clean and staff was great. ,8.3
Noisy on the sixth floor Noisy on the sixth floor,10
The hotel was centrally located right next to Antwerp Central train station probably 100m away which was a huge bonus especially if carrying around lots of luggage as we were (no need for a taxi). We only stayed one evening but found the room was clean and tidy the bed was comfy and the place offered good value for money The interior of the premises appeared dated but other than that no real faults identified.,7.5
Hotel is very close to railway station but city center could be reached in 10-15 minutes on foot. Our room was small but very clean with big bathroom. Wi-fi didnt work in our room (,9.2
I really liked the location it was really easy and accessible for the train station. The hotel is definitely a budget hotel but I got what I paid for. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. I cant really fault it. Its a budget hotel but thats what I paid for I want expecting the Ritz!,10
Best location.Just in front of the train station with so many resturant around.Metro station is also only150 meters walk.Good price.Comfort bed. Basic hotel.No refrig.No kettle.No aircon.I slept very well here because I stay in October and at high floor.If you stay here in summer and at lower flooreverything may be opposite to my stay!,8.3
Location and view great Bed / mattress and could be cleaner the bathroom,5.8
It is very centrally located out of the central station and the citys zoo.  Other attractions are about 10-15 away if you are at a leisurely pace.  Staff are friendly and the hotel room size is okay. No refrigerator.  Otherwise nothing at all. ,8.8
Nothing. It was hopeless except for location No kettle in roomsThe receptionist had no clarity on the document required while checking inSecurity cameras not workingNo tagging of the bags in reception.,2
Situated right beside the railway station this is a superbly situated hotel especially if like us you are on a flying visit. No complaints at all. ,8.3
Friendly and helpful staff. Very good price. 12 o clock check out. Noisy street old carpet no fridge in the room.,8
The Reception staff were very courteous and professional. The hotel was right next to Antwerps beautiful central station. The shower and bathroom facilities were very good. The first room i stayed in a standard single have poor quality furniture and mattress.  The Second room a standard double was a lot better.,9
You can see these rooms are suffering a lot of partys but still its clean.  Bit small room but was clean for the price i payed it was very ok. ,7
 Internet unstabilty Noise (if room is on street side),7
The receptionist was very kind. We didnt stay since it was so loud and the bed extremely uncomfortable.,1
Breakfast is good.. bed size is very small,8
The location was superb as I had a number of train journeys. It was all good,7.9
Location cleanness of sheets price value for money and 24 hour reception.  There wasnt a shower curtain and shower hanger in the bath. So after 4 people taking shower the bathroom floor was a lake.,7.1
ƒ± like the locations male employees were very rude. Although my check out time was at 15.00 they said to leave before 12 I think they did not know what they were doing.,8
Staff were great. Very friendly and helpful. Location is perfect. Good sized room.  Very very loud. Walls could do with a good wipe.,7.5
This was an ideal location across the street from Antwerp Central train station so getting around is very easy. The staff was friendly. The only downfall was that the mattresses are a bit thin but the price for the length of my stay was very good. The location itself is close to many restaurants and shops so theres a lot to do there! Mattresses are a bit thin.,8.3
Clean center place people nice good price The hotel wifi not good (couldnt connect my work VPN whatsapp video call not working)Chek-out time not clear sayng today without timeNo car parking space,7
Good location for transit near the Central Station.  Lack of elementary facilities : no hairdryer fridge.,7.5
Location was great next to train station. No air conditioning.,7.9
best location and safe place. Room is very good and clean. It is surprise with 2 rooms provided. ,10
Location is great. Beds are not comfortable. Noisy environment. Can hear the cars passing by easily.,5
The hotel was pleasantly staffed and comfortable and in an excellent location. Sometimes there was much noise from guests returning after a night out.,8.8
Its right across the central station and is close to the city center but is not within a lot of noise. Doors closed very loudly and there is barely any soundproofing so if you are a light sleeper you will have a hard time sleeping through it in the morning. The beds were very soft so that might be uncomfortable for some.,5
breakfast OK good location of the hotel poor cleanlinnes not very pleasant staff,3
 The bed had a bad smell.All other things were ok but slepping at that bed was a bit gross.,5
Great locations not far from thw train and bus stations in the hearth of the City.starf are nice ans friendly More effort in room cleaning,10
Very friendly stuff on the lobby. No Mini Bar in the Room. Carpets in the Room have to be changed. In the Restaurant stuff have to react quicker when something missing  because  everything missing  started with refilling of food till juice. I lost my 95 euros  but never mind. ,9
Location was fine Room did not have tea & coffee making facilities Bed in room was unstable due to broken leg. Maintenance man did fix it for subsequent nights. Use of a hair drier required 10 euro deposit and collecting from reception each time it was needed.,6
The shower Carpet was wet and dirty the next rooms costumer make lots of noise,7.9
The room and bathroom were clean. The breakfast was poor because there werent enough tables and there was a 10-15 minute wait to get in and then the people were left to deal with it themselves. We were waiting for 20 min for fresh bread. The butter ran out and didnt get replaced.  We also had to make our own bed why?,6.3
Good price quality deal Breakfast room,6
Only spending 1 night in city and passing through in morning so location outside the train station is perfect nothing to complain about,7.5
location Noise on that level  very very expensive publi parking,8.5
Strategic position in front of Central Station very close to the diamond district. Rooms are OK but dont expect anything even near luxury Extenal door was closed at 930pm!! Rang the bell several times and nobody was there to open. On the door there is a post with a phone to call and guess what wrong number (!) Mosquitos in the room Cheap TV set uneasy to operate,7
Ive booked a 3 person room and actually got a 4 person room. That was a nice surprise. Ive stayed at this hotel before (in 2015) and my experience was the same. Spacious rooms and all the basic facilities you need. Rooms are a bit outdated there are some stains on the carpet and some stains around the bathroom to be expected from hotels this age. Not a big deal for me especially at this price point. If the rooms are refurbished they can easily charge more money.,7.5
Great location comfortable bed big room.  Not 100% clean dysfunctional shower pipe toilet brush missing a bit of noisy area due to city center and centraal station. ,5.8
Location was OK. Bed was not top. WIFI was not working in my room. I had to move to the door to receive connection. Working table was to small.,7.9
Good size room nice easy layout and comfortable bed. Good shower! Mostly the staff were friendly except on checkout day one of the staff were quite miserable.,8
Good location close to station about a 20 minute walk to Groenplaats. Loads of rooms so as we were a party of 16 we could all stay at the same place. It was pretty much as expected from other reviews no frills OK price. Not great not awful. Good for a lads weekend away not the kind of place you would take your partner for a romantic weekend! I loved the city of Antwerp far better than anticipated would definitely visit the city again. ,6.7
The staff were nice and gave us an upgrade ,6
Location is perfect which was the main reason of selection. Based on the price compared with other hotels in same location you get what you paid for. Bed was very comfortable and toilet very clean which is an important factor for me. Table was detached from wall no mini fridge or at least a bottle of water which is 1 EU.  Room could not be more basic. Free internet yes but the basic package so no speed watching a movie on your laptop was out the question. My neighbor room had dogs barking regular surprised they let dogs in a hotel.,5
Baaic hotel matching the price dont expect luxury for $50 per night. Clean good bed room was warm great location. A bit dirty under the bed but nothing awful just some dust.,9
In front of central station. I was surprised to the price for the good room even if Sunday night in winter. Check in time is from 15:00 but the reception kindly accepted me at 14:20. Nothing.,9
Thr distance from the Central station and the shopping center The staff was not kind as it should be at an hotel. It was more like they are forced to work there. Especially the staff in the kitchen,5
Extremely noisy environment during the night hard to sleep with open window. ,6.7
So close to the train station. Comfortable room and nice staff. Nothing,9.2
Convenient location adequate facilities and was good value for money.  I was attacked by spiders on the first night and had to go to hospital in Antwerp the following afternoon. When I informed the staff and requested to change rooms they didnt really care about my well being and just told me they changed the sheets refusing my request of a different room. I didnt feel like a very valued customer in that case but you get what you pay for I suppose. ,7.5
 Mattresses could be replaced - they are old and very not smooth so not so nice to sleep on them.,8.8
A small hotel close to Antwerp Station and many of the tourist attractions. Comfortable bed and clean room and facilities Another hotel with good breakfast and selection of food I am waiting for them to provide tea-making facilities in the rooms,9
Cleaning room You can Heard all life of your neihbourg,6
Very centrally located just opposite the central station. Parking was a very problem we arrived at the hotel late in the evening. We were directed to a parking place. The barrier in the park opened when we took the ticket and closed when we moved behind us but the gate didnt open so we were trapped between the barrier and the gate for about half an hour since everyone had left the parking building and we couldnt reach anyone.,7.1
Location next to station Beds no mini fridge no kettle in the roon,6.3
The only good things: - Beds - Location (ahead of Central Station and Parking nearby) The guy at the reception did not greet us and we had to wait a few minutes before he started to help us. Even then he did not even said hello.  The space in the room was okay the beds were fine and clean. The shower did not even had a holder for the shower the shower curtain was dirty all the buttons in the room were sticky and the heater did not work. There were only two electronical sockets.,5
Excellent location for any transport Beds are not comfortable at all,7
The location is great. There were some loud neighbors on my floor.,8
Location: Top Bathroom: OK Nothing special.,7.9
Loved the central location of the hotel. Everything was within walking distance  (train station restaurants shops  etc.) The rooms were not fancy or big but adequate for amount of time we spent in them. Price was great. Will definitely return. The only negative thing that caught my attention were the carpets! They were very old with some dubious stains. With the beds being very low you could see everything!,7.9
Hotel right near central station. Very freindly and helpful staff. Fast WLAN. The matrasses are too soft for me. Worn out carpet.,8
Room was clean. Very good location. Value for the money. Neibour rooms one night were very noisy and comming and going arrount among their rooms at night.,7
Location is great. Simple and clean as we wanted. Helpfull staff Nothing considering the price and the returns value ,8
Location is next to the Central station literally can walk into through the left gate next to the Panos coffee shop The room is just good if need a room cheap WiFi sucks when not close to door it not even a single bar the room bad mattress is low and not good for people with back prob the electrical sockets is weird with no adaptor available reception service at night pretty rude.,4.6
Location is amazing. Rooms are very small. No air conditioning. No hair dryer available. Not enough electrical outlets. Light switch doesnt work. Elevators very slow. BreakfAst over priced.,6.7
Good location for train or bus travelers! Arrived via train just next door and left with a bus just one block away. The room was cleaned but the walls were dirty they even had hand prints on them which was a bit creepy. There was also hairpin on the floor from the previous guest. Other than that my stay was good everything worked and was as expected.,5
1 I booked one room with two beds but I found one room have four beds thats too much for me. 2 no hair dryer 3 the breakfeast is a little under my expection. But I know that the price in Antwerpen is high ,7.9
Everything was fine Nothing about the camp,10
Pragmatic equipment. It was cold at the day beginning. Limited hit water.,8.3
great value for  money good location very safe and secure friendly staff coking facilities sufficient for 12 days table inside and out modern caravan nothing,10
The chalet is outstanding.  Clean spacious (except the bedrooms) and comfortable. There is little in addition to the campsite itself.  We knew before going.,9.2
Free upgrade to a bigger cabin. Calm camp ground. Bring your own bed sheets (or you have to rent them).,8.3
We had a great stay in a very comfortable self-catering chalet in Bloemenduin. We didnt want a busy park with late night entertainment this year (after staying in a bigger and noisier park last year) so we were delighted with the peaceful friendly atmosphere . It is a small quiet park with lovely staff and if youre looking for a great base from which to explore the Belgian coast its well worth a look.  ,10
Theres an open terrace and the location is just 5 mins drive to the center. No garbage bin in the kitchen and in the toilet. Not enough kitchen utensils like spatula and a big salad bowl.,8
Beautiful location by the Meuse. Excellent restaurant with helpful staff. Clean spacious and generally well appointed room with excellent modern bathroom. Good breakfast served by helpful and friendly staff. Good value for money. A safe in the room would have been welcome. It would have been good to have coffee making facilities in the room as well.,8
Easily accessible. Rooms recently renovated. Space for dining in room. ,9
Wonderful views. I also liked the fact that the breakfast was optional. ,9.6
Wonderful views from my top floor bedroom.  I had a turret where I could use my laptop and watch the river go by.  All the staff were excellent and could cope with my somewhat lacking attempts to speak French.  Ate in the restaurant three times.  Food was excellent.  Breakfast was provided by a very helpful and cheerful young lady. The room was clean and spacious with a very comfortable bed. Nothing worth commenting on,10
Car parking next to building. Nice restaurant with spacious terrace. River with dramatic cliffs across street. Room was huge #2. Saw room #4. Both 2 and 4 are in the turret with 220degree views.Breakfast is simple per regional standard. Bed is comfortable. Photos are of room 4. No skylight in room 2. Just a warning that stairs are required to get to room and to get to room 4 it is a bit of a climb for older folks.,10
A beautiful old house with charm located perfectly along the river with a great restaurant just across the street. We had a beautiful view from our window. Lovely. ,8
Breakfast was huge and very tasty. Sitting by the window overlooking the river and having the early morning sun come onto your face. Rooms were spacious with all linens provided. Superb view over the river from the tower room we had. Bit noisy but you get that with the street just out front.,10
This property is adorable. The location is wonderful. Its quiet and serene. The views across the street are perfection! The room was adorable and the bathroom was newly remodeled and spacious. Loved every bit of it. ,10
Everything was nice and super clean ! Breakfast was delicious very friendly people The view from the room is just incredible  ,10
Very comfortable bed very friendly Personal -,10
Both the room and ensuite bathroom were clean and spaceous and beautifully decorated.The staff was very friendly. Love the idea of an ice cream shop and Korean grill  in the same building if we ever come back we will certainly have dinner on location. The breakfast was good however nothing special for the price.,8
Breakfast was very basic but I think Covid has alot to do with this. Nothing specific.  Little touches could be improved on.,8
Its like a boutique hotel with few rooms. We had #4 with river view (la Meuse/the Maas). Room was like a small flat much more than I expected for 69-$. This house is mainly a restaurant so dont expect standard hotel services like 24h-reception. Breakfast was plenty with standard products at 10-$/pP. I liked the bread and the coffee and the Marmelade best. The restaurant is quite good and there are some good Chinese close to this place. Consider you are in a suburb of Namur. The road is busy by day but quite by night. Make sure everybody of your group is able to climb stairs. Less mosquitos please,10
Very big and comfortable room breakfast handmade good position near the river excellent restaurant  ,10
The woman working there was so kind and amazing. We reserved for breakfast but due to circumstances we had to leave before breakast so we called it in we couldnt do breakfast and what time we had to leave. She made sure we had lunch and coffee on the way. This was a lovely touch ! The shower was not really super hot in the evening. In the morning it was fine !,8
Friendly helpful staff lovely location great food in the restaurant. Basic furnishing in room - a soft chair to sit and read would have been nice.,9.2
Beautiful building. Well-decorated and furnished. It was not completely finished when everything is done it will be a great b&b/hotel.The shower didnt always have warm water.,9
Free Parking location on the river old character building and we arrived late and could have dinner at the restaurant. Mosquitos keep window closed.,8.8
First nights stay in a decent room. We had two nights stays on different weeks. First night stay lovelygreat room.Second nights stay was up in the roof with no head room to sit up in bed .Both myself and my wife kept hitting our heads.,7.5
Beautiful location on the river large room (and bathroom) with everything I needed. Staff were friendly and helpful even those whose English wasnt much better than my French. Stairs but Im getting old.,10
Excellent all round. Food superb staff brilliant. In fact everything about the place was excellent and I would definitely recommend. ,10
We loved everything about our stay - very comfortable bed large bathroom with an excellent shower and a really delicious breakfast. The air conditioning and the pool were both very welcome as the weather was really hot. There  house was very quiet and peaceful. It is a 30 minute walk down the hill into Namur which is a good place to find restaurants and to have a walk in the evening.  Nothing,10
The owners were friendly and very informative about the area. The accommodation was stunning spacious and well designed. The balcony was a relaxing place to sit out on and we enjoyed using the pool.  Nothing to dislike.,9.6
Lovely large private room with separate sitting room. Private terrace and large bathroom. Perfect for a weekend with a lived one. Everything was great,10
What a wonderful property and a perfect room. We were expecting something quite special for the last night of our holiday and it comfortably exceeded what we hoped for. Great host great room wonderful art and a bathroom that high end hotels would envy. Just perfect in every way ,10
Everything was perfect! Leaving after just 2 nights!,10
We liked pretty much everything but especially the friendly welcome and pool for a nice cooling did after we arrived. Facilities were excellent. The location just above the Citadel was OK for for the 20 minute walk down to the town but we would recommend a taxi back.,9.6
Warm welcome  Beautiful appartment Tea and Coffee facilities available Nothing seemed too much trouble We have no negative comments,9.6
A nice house in a beautiful and quiet village. Checkin can only be done very late after 18pm and checkout must be done early before 10am.,8
Nothing The description of the accommodation does not match the reality. The is no TV no fridge the bathroom is shared and the the door cannot be locked. The bedding is poor. No comfort at all. The accommodation should not be on offer.,3.3
It is a good place to stop on the way to Han-sur-Lesse Caves. You will share the bathroom and the kitchen with the rest of the guests and the host. She is welcoming friendly and does her best to be discreet. The house has a good potential but needs renovation and more accurate cleaning.,7.1
A lovely retreat in the Ardennes and a most gracious hostess who made us feel so welcome. We will happily return to this lovely BB! ,10
Access to the kitchen good breakfast comfortable beds a possibility to play billard and many walking opportunities around the village. ,8
Edith was a very friendly hostess and served a great breakfast.  We stayed in a family room on the first floor which had plenty space to move around in.  There is a large communal bathroom on the first floor. The garden had enough seating for all the guests.  The guests also have access to a large very well equipped kitchen.  Our small dog was most welcome.  We also enjoyed the large games rooms equipped with a snooker and soccer table. ,8
The location and the host was excellent. There are great walks around and its a short drive from bigger interest points. . The place has a kitchen with all equipment you need to make dinner and you can enjoy it in the garden that is available for use. And dogs are welcome! Not a negative just a note - its a family house turned into BnB therefore the sound isolation is not the top one. But if you get quiet neighbors then its excellent!,8.3
We had no big expectations so everything was good for us ,10
The location is perfect and the bed was comfortable. There is nothing to make you feel welcome and comfortable in this hostel. No locker in the toilet/bathroom no shelves nowhere you can put your staff in the room while exploring the city. To my mind it was bad value for money although it was the cheapest option in Brigge.,5.8
Very nice old building near the city centre with tiny but confortable rooms. The staff was very welcoming and helpful! There was some noise at night since the groundfloor is a bar.,9.6
Great location and the bar its great clean place  Not really a hostel more like a B&B no kitchen facilities at all(no fridge microwave hob etc) no comunal place. Its  bar and restaurant with rooms to rent. Bar until 4:00 and rooms on top. ,7.1
Very good location. Nice bar. Terrible bed seems a water mattress. Bad shower experience.,6.7
Good location friendly staff lively atmosphere bed was comfy. Facilities are basic but clean. Its underneath a bar so loud at night,8.8
Hostel location price. The location of electrical outlets in the room.,7.1
Location of the hostel is great and so is their bar with pool and gaming facilities. The mattresses were comfortable. I had booked a separate twin room which had sticky floors (assuming whatever they use for cleaning) the room was boiling all night (yes I tried to switch off the heating) and one of the bed linen was dirty. The staff wasnt rude but I didnt find them very friendly either. Breakfast was very basic bread and boiled eggs.,6.7
Location was fabulous. Staff friendly and cheerful and looked after you. Shower sprayed around the bathroom. Bit slippery. But as long as you took a bit of care you are ok,10
locationpricestuff facilities were poor there was no hairdryer sometimes soap was missing in the bathrooms ,8.3
Great location and price evening entertainment was a great surprise wasnt expecting it food was amazing very big portion. Staff were very helpful and friendly especially the gentleman who works the breakfast shift. Will definitely return. Would have been nice to have a kettle in room or available to use but staff were helpful in providing hot water when requested.,9.6
The location is excellent. The fact that theres a nice bar downstairs is so convenient. It adds a cool vibe to the place. The hostel part seems quite old and it is not cleaned often.,8
It is just where all the attractions are. No wardrobe in the room. Just bed and table I guess a room in Belgium prison has more stuff in it. The breakfast they offer is just bread and coffee.,7.1
The pub is cool the hostel is in a good location close to the city centre. We have been upgraded to a room only for us free of charge. The walls are too thin and dont block the noise coming from outside the room. The pillow was too big.,7.1
Beds were comfy and the showers were clean. Location was excellent and easy to get to on foot from the station. The 24x7 reception helped because I did not have to worry about delays on my way to Bruges. No handwash was provided in the toilets.  The bar was open till 4am and the noise carried to the rooms somewhat.  But I wasnt too fussed about it as I still got some decent sleep. The staff could have been friendlier.,8.8
Hostel too close to Grote Markt. Near there is a store. Good view. Hostel has a Cofee & bar at first floor ,9.2
The bar is awesome and the location That it does not have Signals for the rooms or storage luggage and it is a little bit complicated to find them ,8.3
The atmosphere was so amazing thanks to being a bar at the same time. The breakfast was sufficient and the location is the one of the best thing about the hostel. The man on the bar/reception gave us a great local map. He was so friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stayed in here! The room is simple and the facilities are a little bit old. Dont get your hopes high its a budget hostel anyway.  The beds were really comfortable though :),7.9
 Mosquitos in the room!  We couldnt close windows because was to hot in the room so we finished with Mosquito bits everywhere,7
Convenient location quick check in friendly staff and clean facilities! Bed/mattress wasnt too comfy,9.2
Good value for money (not dinner which was expensive). Apparently the most hip place in Ghent Bathroom had no locks dinner was expensive,7.1
The location is pretty good however Bruges is a small town so that does not matter so much. Bedding was okay and clean. Since the hostel also serves as a bar it was impossible to sleep (without earplugs) on a friday night. The staff was pretty blunt and almost rude both at the bar and at the hostel but probably because they have to work way too much. In toilets there were no hangers no soaps no mirrors etc. since they are the only private places when you stay in a dorm you only get frustrated. No ventilation in the room and since its so noisy you cannot open the window neither.,5
Staff were great. Bar is fun. Italian restaurant next door is delicious. Location is perfect for exploring Bruges. Close to the action but still quiet enough for a good nights sleep. The room was stifling hot the first night but thankfully the staff fixed it on the second day because it was really uncomfortable. There was no soap in the shared bathroom. The bars restaurant closed at 6:30 so we never got to take advantage of all the perks they offer.,7.1
The place is super close to the center and because of covid I got a 4 bed room to myself. The hostel manager(s) and other staff are extremely helpful. They let me check out late and helped me get in the hostel when I locked myself out. Definitely recommended. Too many people share one bathroom. No private bathroom for one room or dorm.,8
Great location great street view friendly owner speedy wifi Beds are soft and hurt my back.Flor is sticky. Poor ventilation ,7
Location they offer no fans or any other way of ventilation in the room and if you open the windows then the room gets filled with mosquitoes. No warning of it or they didnt provide any mosquito repeller or anything. we booked a twin room the bed was ok the bathroom was clean the only problem was it was too hot and A LOT OF MOSQUITOES.,5
Comfortable bedConvenient location Bedroom was oldBathrooms were a bit smellyNo towels availablePoor breakfast,6.7
The place is in an excellent location The place was not very clean and the guy in the bar seems like he is always angry at guests.,5.4
Good location. Unfriendly staff. Rude while welcoming and promised to have someone in the reception desk next morning at 6.00 am for my check out. I waited there until 6.10 am and no one was there and I needed to leave to take a bus. Therefore I did not get my $5 euro key-deposit back. They took long hours to finally take my phone call and after 2 days insisting they told me to send a mail. I did and they can only deposit the money into a european bank account. They havent done it yet after a week and even if they do I would not recommend this place. Too many problems for just 1 night there. On top of that they have no lift and the bed was pretty bad.,5.4
It was quiet The bunk beds didnt have stairs so it was difficult to climb at the bed. No lockers to save our bags and stuff,6.7
Excellent location.The bar downstairs looks really nice but was closed due to COVID.The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable  ,8
Great location. Room simple but very clean. Despite lively bar room was quiet. Great location. The shower heads could be improved. The current ones are fixed and produce a fine spray in the wrong direction. (Shower near room 20),8
Location. I booked 2 beds in a shared room and one of the beds was a really small mattress directly on the floor.Moreover even though I paid for our stay beforehand through the app they made us pay a city tax (around $5). It was kind of suspicious.,4.6
Friendly staff good location and best of all - crisp white linen!! Well done N/a,9.2
Location is great and the bar is perfect for drinks after a day out! No towels in the room,7.9
Simple but nice clean rooms and veda. Personal was friendly and attentive. Very good location. ,8
The location was good.. The bed was so old and uncomfortable. on friday night there was a rock concert in the reception area (It is a bar at the same time) while I was trying to sleep.. you need to pay for breakfast..,7.5
The atmosphere in the bar and the beers were awesome! The barman suggested excellent beer to order! The beds were too loud.. but comfy!,9.6
Close to the center clean sheets. Toilets and sinks are too small and all the sockets are in the same place so it is not very comfortable to charge your phone.,7.5
Near the center but not worth. They are so many hotels around. Money for nothing! There were all disgusting! For five rooms were two toilets one of them out of order. Poor breakfast tiny and not cleaning room no good wifi rude staff. ,3.3
We loved the location and also the bar located in the first floor. It was the first time sharing a room with more people but at the end it was not a problem for us. The price-quality ratio is good.  ,7.9
Great location. Room simple but clean. Only 3 or 4 power plugs in a room for 6 people and the power plugs are in one corner.,7
Location is perfect. Price was perfect for the christmas vacation They didnt give me soap to washing hands,6
Great staff clean room in a central location great secure storage Shared toilets and bathroom but hey its a hostel,9.2
Only location Not at all clean very congested,5.4
Reading all the reviews we were expecting our room to be an absolute nightmare. It turned out to be decently clean and comfortable. Equipped with just the bare basics a bed 2 chairs and a sink. The bedding was clean and the room did not feel too dirty although it could certainly do with some freshening up of the curtains and floors. It was fine for a one night stay. We stayed on a Saturday where the pub downstairs is open throughout the night. We did not find it too loud and were able to sleep. Absolutely incredible location right at the centre. The pub is a great place to have a drink after a long day of sightseeing Bathrooms could be cleaner. There was also no handsoap in any of The toilets.,7.1
Great location good bar area downstairs  Bathrooms werent clean weird smell ,7.1
 Got bites by a bedbug in a six-bed dorm! I have caught the bedbug and brought it to the redemption. They just gave me another bed in a four-bed dorm and comment that its pretty enough for me in that situation. Highly NOT recommend!,2.5
Very nice location.The hostel also has a pretty cool bar downstairs with pool. In the morning there was a cut off of electricity.The showers had cold water and the regulation of temperature was not possible it was just a press button.5$ deposit for the key if you dont ask back for it they could forget it.,6
I really loved the lady at the reception. The rest was more or less okay. ,6
Just amazing b&b stay place. Amazing staff cool bar on the first floor good price and perfect location. Shared bathroom,9.2
This is a hostel so expect to share if you book late but they do have some double and twin rooms available no ensuite but all is kept nice and clean can be a bit noisy at times but again dont complain if you book into a place with an all night barlively spot with great staff awesome pizzas and a party vibe  Very steep narrow stairways may be a problem if you have issues with stuff like that and not ideal if your carrying loads of luggage but again remember it is a hostel and not a hotel i have given the high marks for a hostel so dont expect 5 star luxury,10
The location is perfect in the city center everything are few minutes walking distance. The stle of bar really good. The room was clean and comfortable bed also comfortable. Breakfast for extra 4 Euro was good (bread butter jam nutella egg tea and coffee) but some meet and cheese missed. In the room was no cabinet or some place to keep our bags clothes just on the floor or in the bed. For 6 person just 3 electrical plug in and 2 chairs. In the shower no shelf for shower gel and water temperatur not possible to change. In the toilette no soap and some paper.,7.5
A bit cheap.. Since its Bruges It was a bar with loud music .. So a bit noisy at night,6.7
Good pizza nice staff and excellent location. I didnt hear much noise but I didnt travel during season. There was no sink in the bathroom. The sink was in the accomodation room. The breakfast was a bit simple,7
Good price and value + amazing location close to the center. Also very nice atmosphere by the bar downstairs. Checkin was very easy and flexible at the bar. The only thing that bothered me was that there could have been a small table in the room and the info sheet on the window was a bit dirty. I think we saw in the description also that there is one bed for 2 people but in fact there were 2 beds (just a small detail we then put the beds together).,8.3
Great value for money Staff could be more friendly,7.1
 -Rude staff-I booked a 6p/room and they put me in a 8p/room-Heating didnt work-The water in the shower was cold,2.5
Very affordable place nice staff good drinks great facilities Way too hot,9.2
The bar downstairs and the happy hour. Only 2 toilets.the pillow was Very uncomfy.,8.3
Location It was a bit noisy since its over a bar,7.5
The location is great and thats the only good thing I can say about this hostel. The hostel is like a maze the stairs are too narrow the bathrooms were not really clean and in the shower the water did not go down the drain. ,5.4
Location.clean sheets. It was warm (adjustable heatingbut there is always smb who barely turns heating of) The worst are showersits a tiny spaceno place to hang smth or put smthwhen you try to open water before entering in order to wait til it comes warm it all comes on you and on the floor. In the end after this experience i havent showered. YakToilets of downstairs are also terrible. Entrance through the door is blocket by those who are having drinks at their bar (its more thing of the managementnot people who sit by the table next to door,7.5
Very nice hotel in quiet green area. The room was big with comfy beds and a nice view on the garden. Friendly staff. They even offered us toothpaste that we forgot. We had a good rest before our next day of driving. Perfect stay north of Antwerp away from the city. The bathroom was a bit small,9
Easy to find friendly and welcoming food was great and hotel has a lovely atmosphere. Room was spacious and well presented could not have asked for better.  Nothing,10
Friendly staff clean and great food.  Nothing,9
A lovely small hotel obviously very popular on a sunny afternoon with local families. Excellent food. A very small niggle but when we arrived the lady in reception said that she would give us a free upgrade. When we checked out the lady then on the desk charged us for the upgrade. As we were thinking more about getting away to a funeral that morning we didnt challenge it so not a problem just a small niggle.,9.2
Friendly staff Hotel nicely decorated  Bathroom could have had better lighting,7.9
Just everything. Is a lovely hotel with Charme as the name of the hotel. Great location Free parking Free Internet and playground if traveling with children. Breakfast was excellent served by 2 hard working women (Nadine & one more) pleasing everybody by running around if training for the olimpic games. Great experience. Nothing appeared to dislike.,10
Beautiful room beautiful hotel. Great breakfast. The check in was a bit hasty and we did not get a lot of information.,7.9
Very personal aproach by staff I missed usb or additional electricity points in room to charge phone and other devices.,9.6
the hotel owners Peter and Elizibeth and staff are very freindly also helpful.  Peter and Elizibeth are very welcoming nothing is too much trouble the weather,10
 You cant find anyone at reception. Everyone is in restaurant. I went to restaurant and ask them for an iron machine and a chubby old man with glasses screamed at me that I cant find an iron at the restaurant. I was ..are you serious?! After insisting asking multiple person and waiting half of hour someone bringed the iron machine to my room.Other issues was at restaurant. When we ordered we waited around 20 min for someone to come and take our order.,7.1
Location and hotel beautifultea coffee making not enoughbreakfast not what we thought Breakfast,7
Very friendly staff at the reception and serving the breakfast. Nice rooms clean and good location. The breakfast was plenty as well. Definitely very good value for money!  The room was pretty hot when we arrived because the blinds has been open. Just a minor detail,9
Everything else. The staff were really friendly and the restaurant was excellent. The Aircon unit outside the bedroom window dont have room 16 if you like the windows open.,9.2
De breakfast was good and the staff was friendly. The parking was full because of a New Year party. Nothing serious since a lot of parking space on de Bredabaan.,8
The resturant the accommodation and the whole team who looked after us during our stay. ,10
Cozy rooms and very nice staff. What is worth to underline is a fantastic restaurant with the most amazing steaks and best pepper sauce that I ever had ! ,9
After a very friendly check in recognition as repeat guest I had dinner at the restaurant. Last Year a had a good meal this time it was SUPERB. Besides the friendly service and good presentation the food was of excellent taste and Quality !!  After a long day of meetings and driving exactly what you are looking for. As improvement I recommend more easy accessible  plugs to charge your devices in the room !!,9
Great hotel. Very comfortable and clean. The service was great. I missed the breakfast but the lady prepared it especially for me. ,9.6
We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival since the hotel was fully booked.  The room was very large and comfortable with warming racks for the towels in the huge bathroom.  We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the hotel restaurant which was also beautifully decorated for Christmas.  The service was friendly and professional and the food was outstanding.  We had four different entrees and everyone raved about their selection.  Breakfast in the morning had a wide selection of breads pastries cereals and hot foods too though they ran out of bacon and it was never restocked during our meal. The shower setup was a little awkward and I bumped my head on the sloped ceiling while climbing into the combination tub/shower.,10
Really nice well kept modern hotel with comfortable beds and clean bedroom and bathroom. staff all very helpful and friendly. we stayed 2 nights and the first day we had a heavy rain all day so were glad there were seating areas around the hotel. did not check the area due to the rain as we were on a motorbike so not sure what was nearby. there were buses going past so could have gone to nearest town or possibly Antwerp centre. food was of a high standard and really nice - desserts were to die for! regarding the motorbike there was gravel in the parking area and nowhere to secure it away from view so the only downside to a great hotel,9.6
There was no breakfast buffet because of corona. ,8
Location  Extremely small and shabby room. Not at all like the photos they show online. The door to the room opened to the outside. Not even a decent curtain.,3.8
Very friendly staff comfortable rooms and nice interieur.  Did not like the unnatural dogs all around.,10
Nice place perfectly fine. On a hot summer  night the place gets warm and opening the windows exposes the noise of the main road. Maybe AC would be a good idea. But this place perfectly met my needs as I was having a get-together with friends in the neighborhood and did not want to drive back in the evening.,7
The staff was very friendly and the bed quite comfortable. The room was not like the ones in the pictures. It was clean but quite old and small. The bathroom door was not closing. I find the rate too expensive for this room. It should be half.,5.8
Very clean. Nice staff. Helpful Managers thank you Peter and Liesbeth Everything was great,10
Beautiful hotel. Beautiful decor. Great host! Friendly staff. Comfortable room with nice view Poor breakfast. We received a paper bag with our breakfast the night we arrived. I suppose its because we are going through a difficult times  with the pandemic situation and there were almost no customers,8
The decor the delicious food the comfort and the general atmosphere of the hotel. LP I liked it all,10
The decor was very stylish felt like a country home. Dinner at restaurant was excellent  100 %value for money. Compliments to the chef !! shower over bath had chain too short set breakfast with little choice,9
Excellent choice. Beautiful and charming place. Awesome hotel. Everything was perfect. Nothing to complain about it.,10
The staff were wonderful friendly and helpful well beyond what you would normally expect. The restaurant is good ad has a wonderful warm atmosphere. Breakfast had everything one might expect . I couldnt fault anything really.,8.8
The atmosphere was cozy and the staff were very kind. We would like to work and the find a good place for as to work. They leave the key somewhere - so we can arrive after 00:00. That was really nice. The room was much smaller than the picture shows while we were booking. Also we booked for two nights. We hoped one big bed - but we get two beds. The shower was not that strong. It was okay - but for that amount of money - we can get alsewhere a bigger room. The breakfast was oke - but a little bit sober: no cappuccino for example.,7.1
Its very cosy place feel like home stay with a lot of privacy.  Our room was very nicely prepared. Have to carry your suitcases on a steep staircase   though its only one floor.,8
We love the hotel the breakfast and the good predisposition of the personal  The location is so far from the city and the only line of buses were not working there.,8.3
The staff were unbelievably kind and friendly. I felt very well looked after and was a lovely place. Big bonus for a last minute cheap booking on the road. ,10
Very nice place. Stayed with kids lots of activities for them. Kids enjoyed playing outside and inside.Nice breakfast. Very welcoming received bottle of wine on New Years eve ,9.6
Rooms were very nice and we had our own little semi-private deck adjacent to the main bedroom.  This is a very quiet area surrounded by farmland with a nice pathway that takes you towards the town and eventually the beaches (10-15min walk).  The grounds have a nice common area with both indoor and outdoor activities for the family. It was close to the beaches in a quiet area and therefore the majority of activities (bicycle rentals stores restaurants..) required a bit more walking to get there.,10
The hotel and the surrounding area is very quiet (although close to the airport). The apartment we stayed in was very cosy and spacious. There is everyhing you need. The owners are very friendly and nice. They let us to put our bikes in their garage. Fully recommend for a short or longer stay. The covid restrictions didnt bother us that much. ,10
ideal for a large family with kidsexcellent breakfast super friendly host family bathroom was tiny for 6 people,9
The owner is nice and friendly. Rooms are very clean and spacious. There is enough entertainment for a rainy day: billiard and football tables.The beach is within walking distance - 20 minutes away from the property. Simple and delicious breakfast is served every morning. The minibar is filled with chilled beverages. (2-3 euro per non-alcoholic drink and wine and cava cost a few euro more) You can have a tea/coffee in the common area but it is a bit pricey giving the fact you have to prepare it and then wash and clean the dishes and the kitchen. At this property it costs 2.30 Euro but for less than 3 euro you can have one on a nice terrace along the beach. ,9
Alles want alles was pico bello inorde Niets alles was in orde,10
Big room with a lovely terrasse looking out onto countryside.  15 minute walk to beach nice restaurants nearby. Nothing,9
Amazing host who took the best care possible of his guests! Thank you so much Delicious breakfast and diner ,10
From the moment we arrived Max (the owner) made us feel very welcome! He is a very caring host with eye for detail always up for a good chat and willing to provide tips about the region. The chateau itself has a wonderful location overlooking a valley. Its set on a very peaceful property but is conveniently located close to Liege Maastricht.. Our room was really nice spacious and clean very comfortable beds and a really good shower! Breakfast was excellent (and prepared with care by Max)! Weve already recommended the chateau to our friends and would definitely book here again! Nothing to dislike!,10
Arriving to Chateau Charles is like entering a fairy tale the environment the driveway to the castle the lights in the orangery are only a sign of what is coming. The extremely warm welcome in the beautifully renovated historic castle in the middle of a well maintained garden. The owner and staff went out of their way to make us feel instantly at home in this unique setting. The breakfast was excellent with a lot of fresh and organic products freshly made jams and a wide selection of bread coffee tea and everything one could need. Before leaving we already started dreaming about our next visit. ,10
Amazing place with lovely staff. Beautifully decorated and well chosen interior. The garden and the terrace are perfect to have a sundowner. We were allowed to use the kitchen to prepare light dinners. Would definetely come again! ,10
Fabulous house and location. It exceeded all our expectations. The host (Max) was very friendly helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast was delicious and the room was delightful with spectacular views over the valley and surrounding countryside. Nothing could be improved upon.,10
Wonderful location with nice views all around. Breakfast was excellent and gorgeous. Very comfortable bed. Personal was very nice with a lot of attentions to the guests ,10
Fantastic castle. Great views. Very welcoming hosts. Highly recommended. ,10
Exceptional authentic castle with lovely grounds. The overall service was not in line with the price. The breakfast was very poor with little choice.,6
Great location and beautiful castle. nice pool and kind staff Very small room for a lot of money. There were stains on the sheets. Theres no WiFi (only at reception and inside restaurant) breakfast wasnt as amazing as expected and advertised at all,5
Great setting close ro the rover modern rooms very clean The room was super small the bed very small so we couldnt get any sleep. The lights in the bathroom are very dark and the ledlight mirror was broke so no way to shave or put make up on in a proper way. ,6
ok food but overpriced no radio or tv in room,8
Very nice castle and nice domain Too expensive - no cooling system no tv small room no fridge in the room. noise from the outdoor restaurant bad soundproofing in the room. Check out and breakfast Hours too early,4
The castle/palace is really amazing with nice inner court and park. The food was also very good both for diner and breakfast. Despite the complicated situation the staff tried to make the stay as enjoyable as possible The information on Booking.com about how meals are served etc could be improved. Also there are accomodations outside the main castle building and inside this should be clearly indicated in the site.,9.2
Excellent breakfast Nice setting at chateau Nice walks Excellent restaurant Rooms and bathrooms new Rooms rather minimalistic No room service,7
Very friendly host couple nice home-like ambiance ,8
Lovely place to stay. Patricia and Michel are lovely people and really made me feel at home. Also great communication leading up to my stay. Well the buses were on strike when I stayed there but Im certain that there was nothing my hosts could have done about it. In fact they told me about it in the days leading up to my stay so that I could take measures and they advised me how to handle it.,8
Great atmosphere and very nice and helpful landlords! Very nice vacinity. ,9.2
Great host very kind and really lovely! Its very close to a metro station and the area is quiet and relaxing. Very much recommend.  ,10
I could come late. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was delicious eaten in a very good company of hosts.  There was a bottle of water at the table in the room - very nice. However the bottle was already opened so probably used or .. whatever. Nevertheless is was not fair.,7.5
Good breakfast and location Old house misses some comodities,7
The location of the property might be on a positive side and also the surroundings. The property is not as advertised. There was no heating the first day rooms are not so clean and the breakfast was poor. Totally different impression than the pictures on the site.,4
Amazing location! Everything is nearby and yet the location is nicely quiet. Friendly staff nice room a very good stay overall.  It was our anniversary and the staff left a little treat and a note which is a very sweet.  ,9.6
Superb location..moments from the metro and near lots of bars restaurants and the city centre. ,10
The breakfast area and the breakfast itself were excellent.  Also the friendly staff at the reception and in the breakfast room were very helpful.  The size of the bedroom was satisfactory so was the view. The bathroom was smelly and although a technician came and it looked that it was fix unfortunately it continued to smell.  Some furniture/toilet bowl in the bathroom need change/renovation. Also the fitted carpet in the hotel corridors needs change or a good wash.,8.8
On-site parking lots of restaurants nearby. The sofa bed is very easy to use and quite comfy. Really small toilet.,7.9
Excellent location very close to Metro shops and restaurants. Relaxed and comfortable accommodation. Friendly and helpful staff.my room My room was on the top floor which was good as Im guessing that rooms on the lower floors could be quite noisy at the front of the building. Requesting a room at the back and high would be wise,9.6
Location was great and free coffee and tea all day friendly staff No servicing of the apartment no secure wifi and we had to ask for extra toilet paper,7.9
It has a good location the staff is kind and helpfull. Also the room was big and comfy with all the things you could expect in a appart hotel. It would have been nice to have the breakfast included since it is 14 euro though it is really complete.,7.5
Breakfast was extremely good and the location could not be better During our 5 day stay the towels were never changed. We knew about the cleaning of the room was only after 6 nights but clean towels?,9.5
Perfect location in center few minutes from Grand Markt. Metro station is in front of hotel. Clean big room very comfortable bed. Helpful staff. ,10
Close to the train station good restaurant options around the hotel Breakfast was below average,8.8
Great location for Xmas markets. Great room for the price with everything we needed. Walking distance to main town centre shops and lots of attractions. Great cafes and restaurants on the same street. ,10
Location is great. 10 minutes walking to Grand Place an 15 minutes to Central Station.Beds were big and comfortable.Assorted kitchenware available.  Maybe price for breakfast is a bit high but there is plenty of options in the area and of course you can prepare your own meals at the apartment,9.2
The location is great walking distance to the centre and right beside metro The toilets are dirty,6.7
The lobby was nice. Dirty.  Sparse.  Checked in and checked out early.,3
Friendly staff. Spacious rooms. Convenient location ,9.5
Near to the Metro nice room reasonable pricegood service! Our room near to the street which is a little bit noisy.,9.6
One could make their own waffles during breakfast!!! Croissants were extra fresh. The area was nice within walking distance from many nice restaurants. The metro stop literally outside the entrance. Cleaning service was charged extra. There was a funny smell in the room the first day.,7.9
 The bathroom smelled foul. Bad smell was coming out from wc. I complained and asked to change room. Not possible. They send a technician that of course could not fix the problrm. Orrible stay. Staff not helped. S nightmare. Avoid it if you can.,1
Very nice location with cafes restaurants and pubs just minutes away and very friendly staff. The rooms are cozy and the kitchen has everything you need. ,9.6
The staff was extremely nice and helpful! Location is more than awsome! The bathroom could be cleaned better,7.9
Located at St. Cathrine which was nice. Staff not very nice and helpful no daily cleaning. Old rooms first one smelled like smoke. Had to complain in order to get another one. We only slept here because most hotels were fully booked. Never again.,3.8
Good location central but quiet apartment looking over a courtyard. Apartment well equipped. I only stayed one night when I got up in the morning found the shower didnt work. I had to leave promptly so couldnt have a shower. I complained to reception but their response was simply that I should have rung reception and waited for a technician to repair it. There was no apology. ,6.7
Great location the staff was nice to us the hotel itself has a modern style. The room was comfortable but nothing special. The breakfast was also very good. Id definitely come back. ,8.8
Location is great and staff is friendly. The room is spacious. Very cold and two heaters did not work.,7.9
Location and free coffee - The room and the building had a smell of cigare- long line for check-out around check-out time only 1 reception desk was open- The room had only towels for one person not for two had to ask for it,6.7
Great location walking distance from the city center attractions  We stayed for 5 nights - the room was not cleaned there was no housekeeping service ,5.8
Great location short walk to city centre. Nice places to eat close by. ,8.8
The location is fantastic with lots of restaurants and a short walk to the historic centre. Room was large clean and comfortable and the staff/reception was great. Handy to have a kitchenette  The bed was comfortable but really hot - even though the room was not particularly warm. A tea towel for the kitchen would have been useful,9.6
Bed was very comfortable superb location - 10 minute walk from city centre!Metro station within 50 metres of front door!  Bathroom had a stale smell!,8.8
Location option to leave bags in storage room photo booth free coffee/tea Seriously short of staff - 10-15 minute wait just to speak with reception,7
 No aircon during summer in Mid June. Only one Fan per room. We hv one bedroom apartment with 4 adult one fan is not enough. If window is opened it is very noisy with people drinking taking and laughing downstairs. Room is dirty staff not helpful at all. No housekeeping unless u stay 6 days or more. ,2.9
Location perfect for exploring Brussels.Bed very comfortable. Wall in kitchen-bedroom had a filthy stain unitthere was mould on bathroom wall- ceiling.Receptionist did not seem to care when we brought it to her notice as we were leaving.We showed her a photo of those complaints.,4
Excellent location. Good staff. Comfortable rooms. Enjoyable lobby area. Nothing special to complain. We stayed here for 2 nights overall experience was good.,7.9
The staff were really helpful and friendly particularly Fabiola. Great location right next to place st Catherine. Room was a bit dated.,8.3
The studio was spacious and had all needed amenities in the kitchen and the bathroom. The room was generally clean but the top shelves in the bathroom could have been better,8.3
Great location amazing view from the window. Nice to have a kitchenette and fridge in the studio room.  Difficult to reach reception (no number in room). However the front desk was happy to help after walking down with extra pillows as only two were provided and toilet paper.,8
Location parking modern rooms No air conditioning,9.6
Small kitchen so you can conveniently eat something in your room Disturbing fountain in the inner yard. No hot water early in the morning when its needed the most.,5.8
 Floor needed cleaning not good when barefoot.,9.6
Location close to the centre yet having excellent local facilities. Free coffee / tea 24 hrs a day! The equipment provided for cooking was adequate at best.  One spare toilet roll was not enough - although it was easy to get more.,7.1
Spacious room with amenities good for an entire family The bathroom is separated from the toilet. You have to cross from one end of the apartment to the other end to use the toilet and then take your bath.,8
We didnt have breakfast since we self catered in our apartment but the room downstairs seemed well laid out with a variety of food and drink.  Fairly central to the main sights on foot in Brussels and with garage parking close by convenient as a stopover for our trip.    Staff on reception helpful. ,7.9
Very helpful staff. Great location.. walking taking metro restaurants and a grocery store nearby. ,10
The place was good friendly staff and clean. This is the first time I saw that the toilet was in another part of the room and the wash & bathtub in another room. You cant just get in to the bathroom expecting to do all your activities in one place.,7.5
Quiet excellent value nice staff central enough location plenty of restaurants and bars in the neighborhood across from a metro station parking available.TVs in each room two separated rooms in the family room equipped kitchen.. There was mould in the bathroom above the shower. Quite a bit. Like it was never treated.The sofabed was not very popular with our crowd. 3 of the 4 who slept on it didnt like it much. I personally slept fine.No decoration at all in the rooms.,7.9
One of the best medium price hotel in Brussels ,10
We liked everything else. For the 1st time we travelled with a baby so it was nice having a little kitchen in the room and it was clean and all the equipment were also clean. There was no hot water on the last day that was a bit disappointing but we were leaving anyways. ,8
Overall good room for the price we paid. Nice with free coffee in the reception. Quiet and dark rooms. The bed was a bit to hard for our liking and water all over the bathroom when showering.,8.8
Very good location close to everything. ,8
Central location the rooms were studio style ideal for cooking quick dinners as we are travelling to a budget this spas ideal. Staff very friendly and helpful. The weather raining!,9
Spacious rooms Excellent location Nothing,10
Excellent location friendly staff brilliant facilities (complimentary tea and coffee) and very clean  ,10
The location of the hotel was great next to the metro station with many restaurants and bar around. The bed was also very good. The room was very hot and there was no air-conditioning. There was an extra price for the cleanup.,7.5
Friendly staff comfortable rooms and the location is just fine! ,10
Fantastic location near the center. Very appreciate kitchen with fridge. Noisy nights impossible to sleep with opened windows. Pillows were awful (like a rubber) contribute to neck/back pain. ,8
CleannessAbsences  location Some basic such as salt pepper and oil should be part of kitchen,9.6
Location was ideal right beside metro walking distance to nearly everything in the city Rooms were very warm and no air con,9.6
Location is perfect and very friendly staff Clean was not exactly good. Toilets did not smell good and the floor was dirty. ,8.8
The staff were very friendly and accommodating of our large group! The rooms were clean and well equipped. The location was fantastic right in the centre of Brussels and a short walk from all the main attractions. Thank you for a wonderful stay! ,10
Very well appointed and communal reception lounge very welcoming and relaxed. Nothing,10
The location is great and near metro They made me wait during the check in until 4:30 pm although it is saying 3pm and I arrived morning. And the lady kept saying after hour and I could see they keep giving the room immediately to who ever comes after noon and she kept saying today is sunny what should we do :/ and keep note that I told them I will arrive in the morning and Im ready to pay half day.,7.9
The location is great. Metro station is close by. It is easy to find. Staff is friendly Breakfast was the same everyday. I missed vegetables,8
Location is excellent as are the staff and comfort level. The building is modern clean and bright. Overall a very nice place. The basin drain seemed to be blocked. Also if the weather was a bit warmer there did not appear to be air conditioning.,9.2
Location location location Veeeery expensive.,7.9
Citadines was a great location just near the St Catherine train station with only a few stops to the major international and central stations. Cooking facilities were good and there were a handful of reasonable supermarkets nearby. Staff were really friendly and helpful. One of our favourite places.  ,9.2
In the city centre close to everywhere. Really clean free tea and coffee in reception staff were excellent really helpful especially Sebastian when checking us in - gave lots of recommendations and help. ,10
Very convenient to city center No air conditioning and the fan was quite noisy so hard to sleep at night..otherwise it was great,8.8
Location is excellent. Staff very nice. Good kitchen in the room and comfortable room. I would stay there again. I didnt realise that the price would be with breakfast NOT included. And to ad a 15 euro breakfast is too much. Cleaning is only once a week. For extra cleaning there is a charge.,8
establishment studio location staff etc. Have nothing negative to say.,9
I asked for a quiet room and got a room facing the courtyard away from the lift. I could sleep without problem. Thank you! The metro station is only 40-50 metres or so away. Free tea and coffee is available in the lobby. ,8
Very nice hotel. Very nice staff. The apartment was clean and with all the utensiles you need. The loadge was big and cozy. ,10
 I had a room looking at St.Catherine square. It was very loud outside until 2:30 every night,8
Close to two metro stations do choose the one closer to the hotel because its difficult to carry luggage on the stone roads. Very convenient to restaurants! Small kitchen had washing machine water kettle as well. Only one laundry in the hotel has to walk from one building to another to get to the laundry. not enough washing machines.,9.2
Its close to various tourist spots and among a variety of good restaurants. The couch bed was quite uncomfortable for my son. Also the movements from the neighbours above us (walking showering and toilets flushing) was quite loud (we stayed on the first floor),7.9
The location was great near to every single place in Brussels. Such a freat neighborhood quite and full of life. The size of the room was a little reduced. You coud barely walk around the bed.,9.6
Almost everything even enjoyed photobooth and free filtered water. None,9.2
Absolutely loved our stay here! It was actually a perfect location! On a square with loads of lovely restaurants loads of good bars on the next street and a 5-10 min walk into the old town and main sights! Staff were really friendly and helpful room was clean and comfortable amenities were provided with extras if you asked for them! Great value for money!Ps velvet peck on the square does amazing breakfast waffles so give them a try!  The pillows were a bit flat (but they gave us extras after asking) and there was no housekeeping but this is clearly stated as a self contained apartment so we didnt mind!,9
We like our room facing the court yard which is nice.  Everywhere we want to go is within  reach and there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby.  The neighbourhood is nice too. An extra towel rail in the bathroom will be good.,9.2
We had a nice stay in the appartment. It is very well located right in the city center. The parking is nearby 3 min walk. ,9.6
Location is really good. Hotel is in really quiet place but close to the center Some furniture needs to be repaired or replaced.,9.2
Localizacion and cleanness were very good Nothing in special,8.3
Quite place Near to fish market and metro train ,8
Very convenient access to metro and local shops/restaurants. Complimentary hot drinks and filtered water in reception Receptionist reprimanded me for filling up small water bottle before I retired for the evening. But he was happy for me to fill up a plastic cup instead. This makes no environmental sense at all and is rather petty given that the room charge for two nights was 300 Euro.,7.1
The studio room had a kitchenette which was very well equipped. The reception staff were all pleasant and helpful. The location was perfect for the Christmas markets. Nothing!,10
All was Super!no special tips all was fine All was perfect! Great and interesting.,10
The location was good the hotel is in a small square with nice restaurants and very close to the city center with all the attractions. The bathroom was not too clean the room was cold at our arrival. There were no carpets which made it feel even colder.,7.9
 Loved the property. Travel hassle free they have everything you need. I travelled with my family that included two young boys (4 and 9 years). They stay was comfortable and right in the middle of all the action (Grand Place). Dont think too much and go for it.,8
Location and having your own kitchenette ,7.5
Excellent location helpful amenable staff comfortable rooms fair price Paper coffee filters should be included if coffee maker requires them. One single roll of toilet paper is a bit stingy.,8
Location and very helpful staff Carpets in the corridors! Not the healthiest and cleanest.,8.3
The location is good- opposite a metro station with excellent connections. Weve stayed in a studio which was adequate for our stay. It would be good to have a dishcloth to use in the kitchen area and a broom as the room is not cleaned everyday. The duvet  was too heavy and hot in current weather conditions and a extra sheet would be a good idea.,7.5
Very nice location The photos  of the appartments that appear in Booking have nothing to do with the reality. The place appears plenty but is completly the opposite. We booked an appartment for 4 adults and the space availiable was really small. For example the wall was 20-30cm from the foot side of the bed making going to the other side of the bed to sleep  quite uncomfortable.       A few days after we booked it we asked for an extra bed but they never said that puting the bed in the hallway (that was the only spot it could be placed) we wouldnt be able to move around the place. Additionally it was not in the appartment and we had to ask it again (arriving late at night).      The blankets had hairs on them.,4
Comfortable bed fantastic location beautiful foyer and lounge area ,9.2
didnt HAVE BREAKFAST-TOO EXPENSIVE Toilet so small you could hardly get in the room.Bath for shower so high very hard to climb into,4.6
Not applicable - No Breakfast Cleaning - making rooms changing towels as well as bed sheets.,8
Nice property in great location. Uncomfortable bed and no fan in room a little warm for people used to AC when its hot outside.,8.8
Great location. Nice room and the heater was very efficient! We had two single mattresses making one. They were rather uncomfortable. The bottom cover was always misplaced! Last two days we nearly run out of hot water??,7
We absolutely loved every aspect of our stay the hotel has to offer. The room was amazingly beautiful and comfortable. The location was very convenient-- right off the 16 tram. And the staff were friendly and helpful. We would definitely come back again! ,10
location basic facilities no daily cleaning,5.4
Its in a great location The bedsheets were itchy I literally have bites from what I dont know maybe from the itching or something. They sure can do better with the hygiene of the towels too.,7
We did not have breakfast We did not have breakfast,7.9
The location in the city centre close to metro stations ,10
Location was good. Central and in a trendy area.Coffee machine free of use. Downstairs tho so not particularly convenient.  Stuffy room. No air flow and little opportunity to open windows for air flow.Staff were not particularly friendly. Not exactly rude: but not friendly and welcoming.Bathroom floor was a bit sticky - yuk!Breakfast expensive and didnt look particularly appetising. ,6.3
The location and the coffee maker in the lobby I think breakfast is a beat expensive,9.6
The location is great. One minute to metro 10 minutes to the grand square lots of restaurants cafe bars near by. The staffs were not helpful with poor attitude. We lost a bag in the room while we changed the room. It got lost in the hotel and the front desk manager only said it was not found.,6.7
The location of the property was ideal walking distance to Grand Place and lovely little streets to walk around on the way!  Staff were lovely and friendly we especially loved the communal area on the ground floor very chic and relaxed.  My daughter was able to do work on her laptop in a lovely relaxed space following check out. The hallway to our room could have been better as there were a few stains on the carpet and it had a slight smell of damp. but otherwise no complaints.,8.8
Awesome location around Saint Catherine quaint streets of food and shops to wander close by and walking distance to the Grand Place without the crowds/noise. Great to have Velvet Peck Farm and Yyoga just next door as well as a handy supermarket around the corner. Nice view of the canal from my front-facing window and great service from staff. Thanks!  Room was simple satisfied my expectations of Citadines but felt a little dated. Common areas are bright and spacious and modern could be echoed in the rooms as well. ,8.3
Handy location for Metro and tourist areas. Helpful staff on recitation.,10
Very nice and cosy room. Everything was perfectly organised from the bathroom with every accessories you can need to the kitchen. All was very clean. The staff was so cordial and always available.  ,10
A clean and well equipped apartment in a great location ,8
Great location with easy access to supermarkets restaurants. Walkable distance to main attraction in the city centre ,8.3
good and inexpensive breakfast there could be more fresh fruit though. nice rooms with kitchenette. good location ,8
Vicnity to the city center yet being far from all the noise was great. Price vs quality was worth it The bath tub was clogged. The cleaning lady early in the morning made so much noise more than what needed,7
Location was great.  If you are into Christmas markets go now right outside the door. 5 min walk to the square.  Good eating places near by. Room could have been a bit bigger however it was OK.,7.5
Its a nice apartment hotel very well served by the metro line. Quiet zone clean and comfortable rooms. Fast check in and check out. An excellent trade off if you are to stay in Brussels for some days of work and you are looking for a quiet place. The room is quite simple and some how old. The bathroom is basic and has only a bathtub. Nonetheless again the room was clean and comfortable.,9.2
Loved that it was a large bed my husband and I really struggle in a standard double now. Kitchenette was great and everything there that we needed. I feel that sugar & salt/pepper would should perhaps be included though. Loved our peaceful room over the courtyard. Staff are not overly friendly but ok. I strongly feel that if you stay 3 nights or more that a clean should be included and not an extra cost. We stayed for 5 nights but I felt to begrudged to pay for a clean when I feel this should be included. Even if fresh towels were given that would be nice.,7.1
Great location. Easy to walk to all the main sites. Room was cold. Took a long time to warm up when I put the heater on.,8.3
Hotel was clean all the services were perfect. Staffs were very cordial.  Everything was almost perfect except few of the kitchenette items were missing.,8.8
Everything was perfect. The location is great the staff was nice polite and helpful the apartments was very clean . We had just one night stay with a child but if I am in Belgium I will sure stay in this hotel. ,7.5
Location is perfect.And the stuff are very professionnal and helpful.The studio has everything you can need.I highly recommand to stay here and will definitely come again. Everything was perfect.,10
Location and facilities provided.  Perfect for a small family. Cleaning is only done once a week unless requested for a fee,9.6
Perfect location Location was great! supermarket and restaurant just around the corner few minutes walk to Old town grand Palace Metro station is just 100 meter away at the property staff was very friendly and accommodating just ask what you want and they will give you advice room was bit noisy because were in the road area many vehicles passing through. The room doesnt have air conditioning it was summer that time i was there they only have small fan and its not enough. All in all it was great! ,7.9
Great place to stay the location was perfect and the staff was very friendly. ,10
The rooms are very small. There is no AC. Laundry facilities very limited. Location was ok with the tub in front of the hotel. Cleanliness space and that there was no Air Conditioner.,5.4
Perfect location right in the city centre. Flexible on check-in and check-out. Clean and spacious room. The cold interior in the rooms the glass shower wall didnt keep the water from ending up on the floor light and noise of the fridge in the room.,6.7
Location! Bathroom could have some more light.,10
The location was an easy 10-15m walk to major sightseeing attractions. Great spot and fit for our family of 5! The apartment is very quiet and everything echos. You can hear everything the upstairs people are doing. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the noise people walking around but it startled me a few times ,10
Great location wonderful having a lift to get large suitcases up to the apartment. Accomodation suited us really well. A bit of street noise but that is to be expected in a busy city (they were having a jazz festival when we stayed). Mostly blocked out when windows closed. Blind in double room not great at keeping light out.,8.8
Great location and big enough for 6 of us! Only One toilet,10
The location is perfect very safe and very close to the city centre. Supermarkets are really close. And the host is very helpful. When we asked for a little help the host was there in half an hour. The apartment was really clean. We did not use but there are also a washingmachine and a dryer. And a dishwasher. Wifi was very good. There is a lift. We enjoyed our stay. ,10
Location was perfect. Close to centre but in a charming and fairly quiet district. Apartment was clean and spacious. Hosts were very friendly and accommodating. Kitchen was a little under equipped and cupboards had old food in them which really should have just been thrown away. Not a huge issue though.,9.2
Location Netflix Internet Washing machine & dryer. Nothing,9.2
Good and clean appartment in a nice neighbourhood with many nice restaurants. Recommended for 4 persons but not for 6. Nothing.,8.8
Excellent location clean and brand-new renovated flat with all facilities needed it. Very cozy clean decorated with taste fully equipped apartment. Perfect location two minutes from the cathedral. Easy to get there. For the collection of keys we phoned the owner who opened us the main door remotely. Smart lighting system drove us crazy during the weekend. The lights were turned on and off at midnight while we slept even if we turned it off. This system is not necessary for a small apartment like this.,8.3
Great location close to supermarket restaurants metro taxis.  Very central.Apartment had all we required - kitchen with plenty of utensils clean bed linen small bathroom but good shower Owner was very helpful - I left jewellery behind in error when checking out.  I phoned him.  He went to apartment found it called me back and volunteered to travel to where I was to give back me to.  Service above and beyond... The climb to the upper sleeping area is a challenge - Not for those who may need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.. And when you get up there the ceiling is quite low.   Children over 8 or 9 and teenagers would certainly enjoy it but not for unfit or elderly!...,7.5
Apartment at the heart of all the activities in the old town. ,10
Fantastic location for the Historical City less than 5 minute walk to the Grote Market & Cathedral. Clean friendly all the usual good stuff of a great host and apartment. Bedroom/lounge was a little small but sufficient if youre out and about exploring and not wanting to sit around.,8.8
Everything is goodÔºåhost real niceÔºåI feel at homeÔºådefinitely will choose Cityhome if I come to Antwerpen againÔºÅ ,10
The location was very good. Overall very good value for money In the bathroom an extra bath mat. The floor got very wet after getting out off the shower,8.8
Position Kitchen Equipment This is more a suggestion: even if it wasnt a problem for us it would be better to make clear that the second double bad is not easily accessible,8.8
Location Not suitable if you are allergic to pets or dustHost was not very responsive on communication The mattress was not in good shape at all,4.6
Ideal location in the heart of the old town within easy strolling distance of the main sights. Compact spotlessly clean apartment in a converted old town house. You need to be a mountain goat to get up the stairs - dont on any account arrive with anything more than hand luggage or a backpack. The automated lighting system takes a little time to become accustomed to. The owners do not live on the premises and open the doors by remote control - so you need a mobile phone.,8.8
Perfect location close to the center. The house was well equipped  The stairs are narrow,9.2
Location is good. The check in was delayed due a flat telephone battery.,6.7
Very convenient location. Kids loved the bedroom. Some mugs would be great to enjoy cups of tea.,8.3
The house was super cozy and comfortable with an amazing location right at the citys historic center. Very clean and super warm with 2 air conditioning systems. The TV worked great the kitchen was super functional and had everything one could need and the hostess was super nice and very available. The hostess could have given us a warning regarding the running out of the hot water. Apparently it works on a water heater or something and once when I was going for a shower there was no hot water. That was annoying but everything was ultimately solved. Also the coffee machine didnt work but that was probably just me not knowing how it worked lol,10
Owners very heplful easy to contact.  Jan was there to let us in and explain how the controls worked. Stairs to apartment very narrow and steep.  Not recommended for older couples.,9.6
Cleanliness location and nice people. Nothing.,10
 I am a solo female traveler. One afternoon a man turned a key and entered the apartment looking for something from the kitchen told me he was the owner he did not even knock at the door. I felt very unsafe for the rest of my stay and ensured the door was locked and the key was in the back of the door to stop this happening again. Absolute awful experience ,6.7
Location and accessibility I felt cheated. When booking I booked a queen bed and it showed a picture of a studio with a queen bed in it. When arriving I walked into an entirely different looking space (cheap looking and smelling like cigarettes) that had a twin bed. When texting the hosts they told me that the bed pulls out to a full.  There was a major lack of transparency about which room I actually booked. I didnt complain because I was only staying two nights and trying to sleep off a 9 hour jetlag.,3
 Service- noiseSmall entrance- very tight starways - no isolation  it feels like the neighbors are at your place,3
Great location kind host The bed was too soft for me so I didnt sleep too well.,7
Cozy flat in the heart of the city centre including all amenities you can wish for to feel at home. 5 min away from Groote Markt 2 metro stops away from Antwerpen Centraal. Flat was clean welcoming and quiet the host Hong a lovely lady was kind and helped with every issue I had. Logistics of check in and out impeccable it was super easy to get to the flat and the landlord was super easy to reach.I very much enjoyed my stay in this great city also because of the accommodation.Cant wait to be back when I hope for the flat to be available. Thank you!Ileana ,10
The location was perfect Living area very small.,8.3
Room is big to feature a family with four.  Interesting decor.  Overall its value for the price If there is a curtain in the bedroom roof window may better.  Kettle need to refresh,6.3
Nice location Very noisey. Could do with some basic  DIY being  carried  out.  Sheets had stains.,7.5
great locationhostquirky decor. inner front door didnt lock very worrying although the outer one to the street did but not very secure access to the apartment through a crowded restaurant is awkward main light switch below a socket hanging out the wall no opening windows in bedrooms and all the sky lights being blocked off stairs very narrow you have to walk side ways to get down them safely toilet seat broken several bulbs not working annoying fan from restaurant going on and off all night shower a bit annoying and both bathroom sinks didnt hold water as plugs leaked.,9.2
Lovely quirky apartment that suited us well  Everything we could want and so spacious  Places to eat  in the properties below Our only difficulty was the stairs so would not recommend for anyone with mobility problems or carrying heavy luggage,7.5
Great look and feel We had requested a 5th bed for a child/young adult and only found a cot. We had to make up a bed on floor from cushions.There was no hot water no soap.The noise from the restaurant below and bar/club next door was loud and prevented sleep,4.6
beautiful loft really cosy and in a really good location. the loft has everything you can ask for! Lots of nice restaurants and cafes! highly recommended we asked for a late check out with the owner and he said it was all okay but the cleaning lady wasnt really happy with this. She was a little bit pushy to get us out and said she couldnt really do anything will we were still there so in the end we last earlier. otherwise is the loft a perfect place to stay! thank you,8.3
Location was perfect.  The loft had a great view of harbour.  Really cool place. Would be nice if there was a hair dryer.,8.3
Overall really super!!! Nice tidy spacious...view is cool too..well - too many goodies ))) Will stay again! washing machine will do the trick,10
Spacious and a fantastic location - Overlooking the MAS and it was wonderfully warm and spacious with excellent open wi-fi from the adjoining restaurant Napos the key collection was easy and painless and I can recommend this Apartment for value location and space (2 Bedrooms * 2 shower rooms) (Unfortunately the Oven/Grill didnt work and there was no toaster) This affected breakfast as there was no way to prepare toast (but this was not a big issue),9.6
Very nice location with splendid view on MAS.  This apartment really has a great atmosphere and is very comfortable. Nothing,9
Specious appartement very nice decorated! ,9
Easy self check in process and directions to very well priced car park $3.80 for 24hrs and only 10mins walk from the apartment. Very cool and trendy apartment that has been decorated to a high quality. Strange taste but nice to explore Some things had not been cleaned eg. On top of things and behind things. Generally the floor and beds were clean but the place needs a deep clean.,8.3
It was amazing and the apartment was bigger than any apartment we ever stayed in. Only minus is noise. It was a little bit louder at night time but that what u have to expect in an area like this.,10
Location is brilliant and great price for city centre. Apartment is huge compared to what you would get a hotel room for same price. The master switch takes some getting used to we had to leave lights on downstairs during the night in order for others to work. Shower temperature is very unpredictable one minute ok next minute scalding hot then freezing. ,7.9
Possibility to park bicycle. Very close to the historic center of Antwerp. High confort. Good wifi-connection. Very good price. ,10
The place is perfect easy to find and enter with the passcode we got in the morning great location clean with everything we needed for a quick Antwerp couples getaway.  The breakfast recommendation Cafe Mundi was also great! ,9
Great localisation big room comfortable bed quiet place easy check-in clear and helpful information from the host ,9
The bed is soooo comfortable and the room is super clean. Very positive experience staying here! ,10
Meticulously clean nicely furnished and far more spacious than the photos suggested. Excellent shower and very well located for the old town. We stayed as a family of 4 (2 young children sharing a bed - both are king sized) and it worked very well. Plenty of places to eat nearby (there is no kitchen at the property).  Internet was a little intermittent at times (short dropouts).,9.6
We liked everything about the room from cleanness to cozy of the room. Such a wonderful place to stay. Wished there was tv and would been  have a perfect night.,8
I had high expectations because it was rated 9.3 on booking.com but reality was even beter than the booking.com reviews. Very central execellent room and not to expensiee. Because it is in the city centre we could hear the music from clubs nearby,9
Very clean everything you need & excellent price. ,10
The property was very centrally located .  Our host Tobias was very helpful and accommodating. A few minor changes would make this accommodation perfect. The pillows are terrible ! Needs softer pillows. A mini fridge would be very useful. Otherwise we would have no hesitation about staying here again ,9.2
Very nice room close to the city center. All the main attractions can be reached on foot. To me it was a bit strange to never see a host or even other people living at the hotel. Maybe I should have done more research before booking but I was definitely not expecting this. Apart from this giving me kind of a weird impression everything worked out fine: the code I got for the main door and room worked well and the room was decorated in chic nordic design. ,8.3
Clean spacious good beds and great service.  Nothing.,10
Amazing apartment in the perfect location Thin walls,9.2
Very nice and spacious room comfortable big bed and washroom with a great shower. No TV but plenty of magazines to kill the boring moments. Perfect position in a quite area few steps from the historic city centre. Acces via code instead of keys works very well and you dont need to worry about losing them! We followed the suggestion of the host to have breakfast at the Cafe Mundi and it was excellent. Room doors are quite noisy so if other guests have very different schedules than yours it might be an issue. We could ear the music from the next room luckily it was of our taste and not too loud neither till late but again that might be an issue.,9
The location is great and the room is nice and spacious. Also the shower is amazing.  Nothing,9
The beds very comfortable and big. The big space and decoration ,10
The most comfortable of bads! Great localizaton very clean quiet large room.  Only dissatvantage is lack od elevator.,10
Comfortable . Easy to check in. Had everything I needed. The position,8.3
great hostclean and quiet surroundings neighborhood fill with history maybe a better way to find the hotel in this area,10
The property was very centrally located and easy to get to. The room was comfy spacious and clean and we loved the modern furniture. We were on the ground floor with large light filled windows and surprisingly a quiet location of an evening. Communication with the host Tobias was very smooth. Access to the property was easy through pin code. If in Antwerp again we would definitely choose to stay here again. I only apologise for our daughters tantrum on the last morning but be mindful we had been travelling for several weeks before coming to Antwerp :-) This is only a minor complaint but there was no mini fridge in the apartment.,10
Really nice interiors. Clean and comfortable room. Comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Located really close to the old town square! Tobias is an excellent and very discrete host. Ideal choice for a long weekend in Antwerp. There was no actual wardrobe.. just a minimal hanger instead. Nevertheless it did serve the purpose.,8.8
Simple but clean and comfortable. Perfect location. Recommended! ,8
Everything was really clean. The shower was easy to use I would appreciate curtains that can cover better the morning light as I have a problem to sleep even with little light,10
Great fully equipped kitchen if you wanna cook. Big tv with Netflix. All in all very comfortable and close to shops and restaurants. Had a very nice stay.  ,9
Great location. Fantastic communication with the owner. All good there. The only thing that could be improved is the Internet signal as it was quite weak on our stay.,10
In general a very beutiful Apartmant in a good location. Many restaurants around easy check-in friendly host. Nothing to complain about :) ,8
Great kitchen facilities Sofa may need fixing,9
Very nice very friendly and helpful host very clean spacious quiet street close to everything I needed ,9
Great location - close to cinquantenaire park ans merode metro. Lots of little takeaways close by - highly recommend snack libanais ok avenue des celtes. Quiet street Convenient parking - have plenty of change on you!  Very noisy neighbour downstairs. We found it difficult to get to sleep. Although he did quieten down after midnight.Also this is a simple apartment - classy is a bit of an exaggeration! ,6
The location is great pure nature and amazing views. Perfect to stay some days with family disconnect and enjoy nature. We would repeat this expirience! in bathroom were somebody¬¥s hairs was a little not pleasure but in general was clean.,8.8
Very quiet location nice area to relax 2 steps from a big and nice aqua parc ,9
The whole area was very quaint with the courtyards and stonework. Even though the exterior was vintage the inside was updated (thick windows lovely shower soft beds). The kids loved looking at the animals in the garden area. The staff were friendly. - We were on the second floor and my husband had a very difficult time with his height. - The WiFi is available but turns off every two minutes or so so might as well not be available. - The breakfast was $15/person and while beautifully presented is essentially just a very large basket of bread a soft boiled egg and a few slices of cheese/salami. We would have loved even some fresh fruit or yogurt.,7.5
 Bad wifi connection and that area smell to cow $hit.,6.3
Great rooms and very nice breakfast. Service went the extra mile for a specific request. Would have been even better if there were a couple of tea bags in the room to make tea upon arrival.,10
Everything was perfect! The host was really kind and the room was quite comfortable and full of facilities (pots pans and crockery coffee machine etc.). ,10
Very clean beautiful quiet and welcoming generous hosts. Large sunny garden with goats hogs ducks chickens rabbits and cats. Good public swimming pool right next door serving decent taverna food at excellent prices. Perfect for relaxing on site fishing kayaking biking and Durbuy nearby. A very comfy dream bed. If you stay a few days you may desire more variety in the $125 breakfast. If you are looking to go hiking this is not the best area. ,9.2
Fantastic breakfast in a great quiet location. Very friendly and helpful staff who provided us with a useful map to get into Durbuy. Great stay. Nothing.,10
Spacoius room spacious bathroom & garden view ,9.2
The rooms were quite nice beautiful farm style. - The breakfast was really poor we paid 15$ pp for coffee 1 egg juice and some bread and cheese/ham (and the butter and cheese/ham was really minimal).  - A lot of noise from the family living in the neighboring house and from the b&b guests.  - The reception was weird as we just picked up a letter and keys and when I sent a message with some questions the answer was that everything is on the paper.,4
Cosy place to stay quite and not so far from Durbuy.  Good parking space  The Wi-Fi was very bad the fridge was very loud ,7.5
Le Petit Gite de Durbuy was perfect for our family weekend in the green! We were warmly welcomed by our host the rooms were nice cosy and clean (great beds/ mattresses!) and the breakfast was amazing. We liked everything!,9.6
Had everything you need for self catering break. Lovely quiet location. Dark colour on walls and lighting could be brighter.,9.6
It was very calm the room was clean and the check in system easy (letter with key in mailbox). It was a nice romantic room. There was also a little kitchen with a refrigerator and fully equipped and even an extra bed for a child. The room was hot (no AC) the shower was blocked on hot water (at least we couldnt change it). It was not at walking distence of Durbuy but they cant be blamed for this because I just looked for a quite place close to.. and didnt mention it had to be in Durbuy. Its not easy to find without GPS and this house number cant be found on the street (you should look for number 21..),6.3
The room was perfect The restaurant is outside the hotel but is very good.,10
Everything was perfect:location clean big and yoy can find everything you need. We would like to come back. We liked everything.,8.8
Well - prepared and very kind personnel.The Internet worked very well.Hot water and heat in the optimal parameters. Breakfast is quite a bit diversified.,8.8
Big room with balcony. Parking is available. Quite distant from city center,7.9
Its huge! Large space open feeling with new everything. The cafe and staff in the same block of apartments is really good. Room is cleaned good everyday. Great for work with nice and comfortable furniture. Kid safe if you have a family. They have 2 different room types. The larger one has separate room. Everyroom has large windows to let natural light in. Reception works most hours allowing easy checkin. Not much around here mainly for work stay. The cafe could put on a better breakfast as its bland and same everyday.,9.2
Prefect stay as always clean comfortable and everything you need. Close to everything and city center.Nice and helpful staff  Nothing. All prefect,10
Very friendly and professional staff. Room was super clean and comfortable. Hopefully next time will stay here longer. ,9.6
 Too less options of cafes restaurants  bars bistros and pizerias around the hotel.,9.2
Apartment hotel is situated in quiet neighborhood just a few minutes away from metro and bus station. Rooms are bright spacious and clean. Staff is great and very attentive and helpful. Hotel parking is accessible and has a lot of space. Wi-fi signal is stable and there is a lot of power sockets in the room so if you work on the go - its just a perfect place. ,9.6
Really clean and comfortable apartment with modern design. They give you full set of kitchen stuff that all clean or new. Another good news is supermarket in the next building with working hours 8/9-23 and cafe. But we didnt visit cafe only looked at menu and it seemed interesting.  Only one thing may decrease score for this apartment. It is that you have not view from your window. But if its not point for you It would be great place for stay.,9.2
Restaurant was very goodportion size was very very generous and tasty.Lovely cozy bedcleannew and simply excellentall round. ,10
The location is great just 2 metro stations from the city center. The rooms are spacious and clean. Theres a hairdryer clean towels a TV set a kettle and some cutlery in the room.  ,9.6
Comfortable bed complete kitchen When you take shower water is licking out of bath so the whole floor is wet. Also too strong smell of smoke every morning needed to leave windows open.,10
Very clean lovely friendly staffSecond time staying there and really like it. Nothing all prefect,10
In general you get what you see. This is not 5* hotel so  didnt have much expectations. It was very clean everything that is needed was there - like towels bath utensils coffee/tea. The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly. The price a little too high for this kind of place.,9.2
I fore sure visit this hotel  apartments again It is quite area secured and the flat is big enough and comfortable. The staff at the reception were helpful and friendly especially Valantina if l spilled her name correctly. ,8.3
Great place for a great price! Maybe a little bit too hot because there was no air condition. But it is ok no worry about this.,10
The staff is very friendly and ready to solve all your problems. Very spacious room. Good breakfast. Wi-Fi connection is poor.,10
Clean spacious comfortable. Quiet area.  Mini market grocery thereabout. Metro station close. 2-3 station the downtown. The blanket was small. There was no dining table.,9.2
All was very clean.. Towels need to be renewed ..new sets are a must ,10
Nice and clean apartment with kitchen well equipped. I came late at night reception was working and I was checked in very quickly. Internet connection also very good. Bit far from city center but nice village surrounding.,10
 The bed and pillows could do with renewing,7.5
 Noisy place (I heard neighbours from other condos). Door not secure. Shower drain were stucked and condo flooded with water very easily. Kitchen is small and dirty it has no accessories (no cleaning cloth no kitchen paper). Kitchen closet are badly installed and designed (no draining for plates doors mounted in opposite direction). Toilet was dirty.,4.2
Having a small kitchen is always nice. The price is more reasonable than a basic hotel room within the city limits. The room looked a bit dusty and used. The toilet smelled a bit. Very limit number of tv channels.,7.5
Close to the city center and cheap No reception,8
How comfortable the room That there were not enough utensils,9.6
 Overal OK but dont expect much. Have you ever seen a check-in Tim set at 16 oclock? For me this is the first time. With quite an early checkout at 10. I guess cleaning a room takes 6 hours? Check-in and checkout times left me 2 of three days on the street. Despite having requested somewhat later check-in and somewhat earlier checkout while booking they said they would try. However on the ground employees just dont do any effort to be helpful except from apllying their unnecessarily strict rules. ,6.7
central  city  location no  internet  at  all  working  !,4.6
ok kitchen enough space for two persons central location in leuven bed were quite uncomfortable loud other guests poor isolation,6.7
Ambassador Suits have very good location and better rooms. Mr Daniel was very responsilibity and very polite. In Condo Gardens room was too small and in the bathroom wasnt the light. The stairs terrible.,6.3
Hot water was always available. The idea of this apartment is a great idea for travellers. The apartment needs a good deep clean . The shower curtain was revolting and desperately needs to be replaced. Bedding also needs to be replaced. Heating needs to be upgraded as I had to use both electric heaters during my stay.,5
We were in Leuven for Werchter Boutique festival and this was the perfect place to stay for the one day festival. Its 15 mins walk from the train station and 10 mins walk from the old town.  The split level apartment gives plenty of space for the stay including a small kitchen area for self-catering. Condo Gardens Leuven was a great base for our trip. Some of the fittings eg electrical plug sockets are loose and need replacing - but still work.  The apartment could do with updating in terms of interior decor and some of the furnishings.,8.3
 The heater is not be operated. The water pipe in toilet doesnt drain. We try to contact staff but they didnt pick up the call.,5.4
People in reception were nice. I expected the room to be more clean but specially regarding safety there are many things to improve. I had paid four nights there and I only spent one because first night someone tried to go into my room after midnight. The front door as well as the main door of the building were opened the whole night so anyone from the street could easy come into the place. Many noises during the night coming from outside and other rooms besides the annoying hum of the refrigerator. Furthermore no refund was possible. I would not recommend it.,4.6
decent room good location very noisy bring earplugs,7.1
Leuven is a small town so everything is easily reachable. What I liked is the fact that amazing biological zero waste shop called Content was just around the corner and in front of it there was an artisanal bakery. Really amazing combination just next door. The sink in the kitchen was clogged same for the shower (to a lesser extent). The shower wall was old and could be cleaned better. The worst was the fire alarm that was beeping every 2 minutes when I arrived (batteries were dead). So I had to take it off to be able to sleep. There was no hair dryer nor the iron in the apartment.,7
Nothing stands out. The room is a very tired students residential type squat. Bed was basic and very uncomfortable. Close to town,4.2
The facilities the open space (though we couldnt make full use of it at this time of social isolation due to Covid) ease of check in and check out remotely. A little more info in the room re things like rubbish disposal local amenities. Having said that whenever I emailed the property I got an instant reply so I wasnt concerned I couldnt find out any information.,8
The service is well organized and quick to complete. The rooms have minimal but working facilities. Location is okay considering the size of Leuven. Rooms should be much cleaner. It looks like nobody cares about cleaning thoroughly the apartments after each stay.  Beds and facilities are ok. Dirty floors.,5.8
 Cobwebs all over apartment construction works going on in apartment next door cango hammers working from 7.30 both mornings could not relax we should have been informed about this,4.2
 The flat shower had a permanent strong unpleasant  humidity smell there were rats in the roof making quite a lot of noise ,7
Location was great The room was not clean dust was everywhere bad smell in bath,7.1
Check in was smoth Walking distance to Leuven square  Very very dated the electrics looked unsafe and the stairs were treacherous the directions given by the host for the parking space were really difficult to followMore like a homeless hostel with your own room. But you can see they are trying to improve  things ,5
the facilities are simple but complete. I hadnt noticed that the incheck hours were limited and the reception was closed when I got there.,7.1
Superb secure gated compound with top quality rooms in a perfect location. Nothing,10
The outside was lovely The apartments are cold and dark very low ceilings and no floor coverings on the tiled floor. The electric heater took hours to warm the room and I had to work in my overcoat and scarf. The stairs to the beds were like a ladder so steep and no hand rail. The bathroom is very old with dirty exposed pipes.  Holes in the walls and the door.  The cleaners were screaming and fighting in the courtyard.,2.9
Convenient place for a medium term stay in Leuven. I booked a studio with double bed which was much more comfortable than the single room I had the last time. The layout of the room is bad strongly reducing the useful space. The lighting inside is absolutely insufficient.,7.5
The room space and the furniture are OK. The beds are nice. There are kitchen menage TV set couch lamp heating bedclothes and towels. All of them are OK. There were not lift.  The switch in the bathroom is inside the bathroom cabinet. The shower floor is too high with respect to the bathroom floor. The lights in the room are not well distributed therfore it is difficult to distinguish details in some places like the wardrobe.,8.3
Well furnished room with kitchen and ensuite bathroom. Wifi in the room was unstable and very slow,8
 Smell from the bathroom that due to absence a door between room and bathroom made my stay there very uncomfortable. The shower was broken and almost impossible to take.,5.4
I was only there for a very short night arrived late and left very early. The bed was clean and very comfy and not too warm I prefer it cool. Didnt use any of the facilities. The fact that the wall sockets were half hanging out of the walls. I needed to plug in my laptop and needed to get an extension. I forgot to ask if there was wifi and there was nothing in the flat to say what the code was. As I arrived late and there were roadworks I couldnt use the parking space allotted and although the concierge was helpful in telling me I needed to feed the meter where I was parked I could have done without that. Sadly his directions on how to get to the parking space I couldnt understand.,8.8
 - extreme dirt and mold/mould  - I asked for a room change several times yet the manager said there was no other option which was not true as the company has other buildings/apartments - I complained and was promised to have a feedback till now nobody contacted me and there was no feedback so I will make a written complaint - if not a must avoid the accommodation,2.9
there are all facilities kettle iron microwave.  quiet place 10 minutes walk from the historic center. Express check-in dirty floors,8.8
Reasonable price. Small kitchen. Located within the city 15min walking from the center. The host was kind to give me an upgrade after something went wrong in the room. Looks like the buildings could use some renovation. This is the second time something went wrong in my room. The upgrade I got even though it was bigger was not so comfortable. Could hear the neighbor talking late at night as if he was in my room. Wifi was very weak and unstable.,7
Very nice hotel and cleanclose to the center of the cityLeuven is nice city!! ,10
A complex of studio apartments around a courtyard just outside Leuven centre. The apartment was a little dated but included a kitchen. For the price it was extremely good value. Could have been more bowls cups glasses etc.,8.3
excellent grounds and facilities rooms were a little tired,7.5
Beautiful setting fantastic location in a lush and well kept park remarkable architecture full of details and history excellent service. Nothing to complain about.,9
Reasonable accommodation especially considering the price. It fitted our needs on this occasion. Generous space. Cleaning should be improved to make it more appealing. This was our second stay in this hotel but we were this time given a room opposite the outside area used as a bar in the evening  and it was quite noisy..,7.5
Nice little town. Nice room quiet and well furnished. Good big playground for children. Poor refrigerator. Lack of a kettle.,9.2
clean friendly good breakfast buffetvery well designed for people in a wheelchair (7 rooms) breakfast buffet ending time,9.6
 No desk Recurring problem with electricity,6.3
The friendliness of the staff. The fridge in room did not work. No air con or fan in room.,6.3
Location was good they accept all types of dogs. Old towels and bedding very uncomfortable beds the bunk beds for the children were not safe - thankfully the room had an extra bed so that the children did not had to use the bunk bed. Too expensive for what is offered!,4.6
Great hotel lovely little village breakfast was superb ,10
Nothing The property is far. Thank god we had a car. Restaurant is open for less then 2 hours. Rooms are very crappy. Rooms verry hot in the summer. Airconditioning does not work at night. They are shutdown on purpose to save electricity. I would not be going back.,3.8
When we arrived we were tired so it was really nice to be welcomed with a happy receptionist who was very helpful and knew what she was talking about the room was nice and roomy both clean and comfortable we wouldnt hesitate to stay again if in the area. not much to dislike unfortunately we arrived at 19.50hrs to be told the on site restaurant closed at 20.00hrs so we were too late which was sad and we thought a little early to close but there were alternatives close by.,10
The location and facilities were very good the staff were all exceptionally helpful and nice. Air condition was broken during our stay and that made it a bit rough to sleep during a european heatwave.,10
A lovely hotel with a nice breakfast and has everything we need. It was our third stay there on route from Britain to Germany. Antwerp is breathtaking. The very noisy cockerels woke us up about 4am and didnt stop until 6am or later.,7.5
Lit confortable. Breakfast costs 1150 and its only cheap quality products probably from Lidl. Breakfast is from 8 to 10. At 9:30 they were no eggs nor bacon available. We waited a little bit and ask for more (after looking for the lady for 5 minutes). Then they said the kitchen is closed now. I complain but they didnt not proposed anything. So poor service especially for the price of this breakfast. ,6.3
Location & self contained. Access & stairs to property were under renovation & was a shock to us we didnt expect anything like it. My partner was in tears when we opened the door. However once we got into the apartment it was fine. It would have been better if we had some advanced warning re the condition of the access.,6
 Its not an hotel its more Airbnb like it has none of the specificity of an hotel.. and the place is above a bar that closes at 2 it could be nice to mention it..,4
Easy check in Clean apartmentsGood wifiPrice-quality 10/10Highly recommended  ,10
Well decorated flat with nearby parking friendly host ,10
We really like the style in the room and very functional. Its close to the main shopping street and there is a supermarket cross street. The only thing need to take care is apartment have narrow stairsso dont bring your big or heavy size luggages here~ ,9
 Maybe the noise of the neighbours but its normal for the location. An idea is to separate the toilet from the sleeping room. Otherwise a very good appartment,10
Thx for  the nice service . We will be back here for sure !! ,10
Local products in breakfast (bigger portions would have been welcome) the host was welcoming with nice tips. Beautiful setting nice decoration warm and very clean room! The map led us to a wrong first address (a parallel street leading to a dead end)- be attentive with the instructions you follow. We would have appreciated a message ahead of our reservation with the address-details from the host as it was not very clear.,8
Spectaculair B&B on a beautiful location. Warm welcome!! Room looks great. Breakfast fine. There was also a swimming pool. Fantastic quiet place! It was very hot when we were there and the room was also quite hot. A fan would have been nice.,10
Fantastic stay. We were looking for a little escape in a scenic area and it more than delivered. The rooms were great having the swimming pool was wonderful and breakfast was fantastic. Enjoyed every minute of our stay. ,10
Quaint b&b sounded by nature.  If you want to have a relaxing visit to Belgium I highly recommend you stay at this B&B.  The owner makes you feel at home and is very attentive.  Nice pool with great view. ,10
This is an incredible place with a fantastic owner who makes you feel like home. We enjoyed a great scuba diving weekend in the area and could each night relax and feel comfortable. See you soon again :) ,10
The B&B is located on exceptionally beautiful grounds. The architecture feels modern and authentic at the same time. Classy place as is the hostess! ,9
We had an amazing time at cote verger. Stunning location beautiful rooms pool with a view and above all the warm welcome of our hosts made it a truly memorable experience. Cote Verger is the perfect place to take a small break from the normal every daily craze and recharge the batteries! ,10
Its fair for a new country in a new tourism steps. All fair.,5.4
VERY polite and helpful staff. Room was of standard size in a warm classical style. Very nice lobby bar. They have also a nice SPA zone however I did not use it. Excellent location in central Minsk - near to most important places and institutions. Comfortable big bed. Room was clean. Some elements in the room especially bathroom are calling for urgent renovation or at least repairs - especially leaking shower cable and leaking toilet. Some elements of the room especially in bathroom seem to be very long used. Modest breakfast.,8
Location is perfect. Service at the reception desk was friendly and quick. Good breakfast. Comfortable bed. There are smoking rooms in the hotel and the smoke was coming through the ventilation into my room and particularly into the bath room. Room was quite dark and without reasonable lights. Corridors are also dark. I did not like that security people have been sitting in the corridor during the day.,7.9
I was very much welcomed by the staff since I entered the hotel. The staff were very kind and caring (Specially the staff who helped me on checkout). They have marked a great first impression which I really appreciate. I must thank the whole staff and the concierge staff Alyone for her wortg it recommendations. There is nothing to speak about here.,10
Perfect location very good breakfast The room was ice cold when I came in theres a long commute to elevators,8
 Somebody was smoking close by and you could smell it in your room.,6.3
The bed was really comfortable. The location is also good point. It is nearby the main square and street with access to metro train station and bus station within 10min. A lot of nice restaurants around as well. The staff was really helpful as well.  A bit old looking hotel for 5 stars. Because of the nearby casino some night guests are noisy during the night and early morning. Not recommend for families. ,7.9
Location and staff friendliness are amazing Well a little bit overpriced.,7
The room is large the bathroom is huge. The staff is extra friendly and helpful. In a great locationnext to the stadium and lots of wonderful cafe and restaurants. Grand swimming pool jim and jacuzzi. Very good value for money. The location on booking.com is one block away from the actual location of the hotel.,10
 No one could help a woman with a heavy suitcase.,7.5
Great location Overpriced both accommodation and meals. Turkish management and Casino visitors make it too specific for those who are looking for the real 5-star services.,6.7
Very dedicated concierge who deeply searching my satisfaction ,9.2
Professional in communication and find resting for guests ,10
Very central. Great standard service with all the 5-star credentials in place. Good gym and pool though sauna did not work. The hotel is a bit rundown. It seems it used to be great when fresh.,7.9
beautiful house for a weekend! Only one toilet,8.3
Highly recommend this wonderful little gem. Perfectly located quiet street and was stocked with more staples than any other place weve stayed ( ie: coffee tea cereal clear and accessible information). My 7 year old daughter was thrilled and feeling like a princess in her own attic bedroom..The only note is that it is NOT for anyone without high mobility as the first staircase is extremely steep and the second staircase is more like a ladder.. and all beds are upstairs. There is however a comfortable couch on the main floor. We would certainly stay here again if/when we return to fairytale Bruges.  ,10
Very close to City centre! Its nothing to say.,10
Location and helpfulness of the hosts was excellent ,10
Beautiful home. Welcoming hosts. Great location. Perfect property to spend our Christmas in! Thanks again ,10
The location of the place within Bruges was amazing. Quick to reach everything by foot while not having all tourists look into you window when you are cooking or having a meal at the nice table in the living space. ,8.5
Beautiful design house very kind owners wonderful location  ,9.2
The property is a large clean modern townhouse with good amenities and within walking distance of the train station and the zoo.  After my first night (of the 2) I was moved to a lighter upstairs room with a window.  Great value for money with free coffee and wi-fi. On an additional note the owners are absolutely amazing a friend sent me mail which arrived after I had checked out of D.Cristina.  The owners very kindly took the mail to the post office and arranged for it to be sent onto me in England (lifesavers).  A1. The tourist attractions arent really within walking distance of the property.  There is a shared bathroom but there is one on each floor.,9.6
Very clean There was no one at the property when I arrived. I wasnt told that I needed to phone the owner to be let in.,7.1
Everything inside is new and clean.  You have a room with a single bed which is very good. Even with windows open no noise from outside. Good Wifi. Location is not optimal but if you take care to take the shortest route to the exact! address then it is quite okay.   You share the bathroom facilities with at most two other people.,8.8
it was very nice and the wifi was excellent there was no washer and dryer like I was expecting. the stove was not operable you could only microwave and toast.,9.2
Everything is very new. Shared athroom is very spacious 5 star! Kitchen/living room is big. Oven and stove are not in use. My room has no window but is good enough for me. Only thing is that no soundproof at all.,7.5
Perfectly located guest house - almost in the center. Extremely clean. Well-equipped kitchen. I would recommend! ,10
Very comfortable room and good facilities ,10
Good wifi. Communal kitchen OK. Horrible location. Hard to get to and very hard to find. No name on building. Only a number. Tram stop was about a 15-20 minute walk. I only saw the owner on the day I arrived. Very limited English. +No lift. Steep stairs to get to my room.,4.6
Newly renovated clean place right next to a new park and in walking distance to the city center (about 20+ min.). Free coffee and tea. The staff who registered me only spoke Portugese no English. At first I had a room without a window which was totally unexpected and hard to deal with. Fortunately I was able to move to a different room for my second night. The neighborhood seems to be up and coming but still a little rough around the edges.,7.5
The location is great despite looking at the map it might look like a little out. All is really good there and it is very easy to find. That is not always true in some places. Well the floors are creaking and it is true that the house is not very sound-proof. That didnt bother me apart from the fact that I didnt bring my headphones and had to listen to music as low as humanly possible.,9.2
It was very cozy beautiful and perfect for what I needed.  The walls are very thin. You can hear everyone talking even moving through the walls.,9
free coffee good average between price and what youve got  I made a check-in earlier than  they normally do and it wasnt a problem clean wifi worked nothing to really cook  there are a microwave a fridge and something to boil water but that s all if you have a room near the street could be a bit noisy the evening,9.2
Good clean accomodation with a nice kitchen. About 12 minutes on foot to the railway station close to the port. Toilet seat was a bit broken other than that - no complaints.,10
Very clean neat and comfortable A little far from the center for walking,9.2
Really good looking hotel with lots of nice extras friendly staff and nice breakfast. There has been a lot of attention invested in the hotel and you can surely see that. Loved the check-in box with the iPad and the common bar. Few things could be better: not all staff members could speak English to a decent level single bed was on the small end and the pillows could be more comfortable.,9
The events outside There where some facilities like a welness and home cinema but not everything worked at the time we got there lots of people had problems using the home cinema so it wasnt used instead,7
Lovely view You can BBQ in the garden near the tents. Modern and clean hotel Good breakfast Sauna Pool The beds in the tent were awful probably the worse beds I ever have slept in. There was only 1 shower for the guests staying in tents.,8
really nice simple minimalist accommodation with super staff in a lovely environment it fulfilled all expectations,9.6
Very nice quirky hotel. Lovely outdoor space where Glamping is available. Smallplunge pool was super. Good restaurant a short walk up the hill 5 mins. Nothing.,10
everything was perfect except poor noise insulation in room because of the rooms doors :) ,9.2
Very friendly staff modern clean and comfortable accommodation. Close to Malmedy and surrounding area good facilities well worth a visit.  ,10
The location is great and the mix with industrial and nature makes it a great place to relax! The bed was to hard to sleep for me. But the rest was amazing! A place to find peace!,9
This is a bit unusual hotel very tiny rooms but very nice common spaces. The living room with the views towards nature was wonderful.  Breakfast was lovely the small pancakes brought to the table were supper fluffy and melting in the mouth.  The pool is tiny and a bit cold but our kids enjoyed it. It was very quiet at night. For a hotel attached to a recording studio I did not expect to have radio blasting in the common spaces. Would it be difficult to play some record or a playlist? The lightning in the room was dim.,9.2
Clean. Nice staff. Modern. Relaxed. Easy going. No worries -,9.2
Fantastically different and refreshing nothing not to like! Nothing,10
 Having a light in the shower would be nice and a water bottle in the room would be appreciated too other than this perfect,9.6
Good breakfast however a bit strange to seperate Hotel and Glamping as it is done Glamping way too overpriced (Formula 1 weekend),5
Another style hotel concept of cinema spa and drinks for use. Great Rooms a bit small,8
The hotel is well-located and the room was clean and well-equipped. The breakfast offered had a good selection. The staff were friendly and helpful. ,9
Good location and nice little boutique hotel.  Well appointed and tidy rooms.  Staff were very courteous and friendly.  Close to everywhere one would need to go The rooms at the front of the hotel are right on the main road.  There was very little sound insulation on the windows and so In was woken repeatedly by cars delivery trucks and garbage trucks.,7
The location of the hotel is amazing. Right off many of the most important streets and very close to the center. There is a fairly strong smell which comes from the bathroom downstairs there are plenty of ways this could be addressed so it should be. There were also stains on the throw on the end of the bed which were not subtle stains they were quite obvious,6
Great location - easy walking distance for the tram line and the grand place old area. Wifi was reliable. Room was very clean. Lot of restaurants in the area. Have to use key card in order to turn on power - this makes recharging any batteries while out impossible. I wouldnt want to spend more than 1 night here (which is all I spent) found the room cramped.,6
Very good bathroom nice room lighting was good I do not remember the minibar whether it had or not  a small balcony the bed was comfortable the lobby was cosy! Location was great and 2 minutes to Center by walk Nothing,10
Very clean and spacious. Very nice personel (they always smile when they see us). The lady at the dask was nice ,9.6
Yes the bed is comfortable The internet is not goodvery slow There is renovation in the reception,8.3
Great location and comfortable clean rooms. The noise from the bars/pubs around the hotel were disturbing during the nights especially Friday and Saturday.,8.8
The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. Bathroom mirror lights are very good The best was the location close to the Christmas markets. Staff was very helpfull and friendly. We received free breakfasts due to a water outage late in the evening Sound insulation could be better as the street noise (police sirens etc) woke us up several times. There is no elevator to the 6th floor Bathroom sink is rather low. No street parking in front of the hotel but several parking garages at walking distance,7
Nice hotel clean and well designed. Superb location. ,9.2
Location is good very clean and friendly staff. ,8.3
the room was spacious very clean and very warm. the place was in an ideal position and the wifi signal was strong. the bed was comfy. the metro was very close as well as something fast too eat. we arrived at 01.00 and at 100m was an open 24/7 mc donalds to eat something fast and go to sleep. overall it was an excellent choice the lack of a mini fridge although everything was out so it was kept cold from outside. the water drainage in the shower was not very well placed and as a result the water was spreading throughout the bathroom,9
Well located and connected by public Transport. Close to grande place. Noisy neighbourhood with noisy drunk people in the street. ,6.7
Location good for some places.  Easy access to metro. Good places to eat nearby. The rooms are either stuffy or noisy (stayed here 2x).  Street-facing rooms are very noisy most of the night.  Back rooms are stuffy.  No AC and the cooling fan doesnt do much for comfort.,7.9
Very warm and cozy The bed should be replaced.,8
Good location. Small hotel with small rooms. Limited buffet items for breakfast.,7
Location is perfect for central Brussels with 10 min walk from the Central station. I got a room on the first floor which was rather dark and looked out into a tiny brick yard with light coming from way up only. The room was clean and spacious but some details were not great for example the plug did not fit the bath there were some chips off the tiles. I didnt have breakfast as I thought it was a little expensive. The price was very high but this was the same for all Brussels hotels that night owing to an international football match.,6.7
Location was perfect and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was very limited and the area allocated was much too small.,6
Location The lobby is under construction and they didnt inform before check in.,7.5
Provides extra pillows and hangers on request. Nice handwash etc in bathroom.  Location was excellent. Size of room was on the smaller side and the bathroom was tiny.,7.1
Really nice room. Good bed. Maybe to good as we missed breakfast :-) X,8
LocationClean rooms The room and the bathroom were too small. Also my room was on the front side it was so noisy that I couldnt sleep,7.5
Awesome location (right in the center of Brussels) the room was superclean and quite spacious! As a plus the staff are willing to store your luggage before check-in and after check-out. The shower cabin wasnt leak-proof.,10
Clean comfortable great location! The noise from the street was quite loud in our room. Have stayed in many hotels before and found this unusually loud. In saying that if you dont mind hearing the traffic the room itself was gorgeous and location a massive plus!,7
Room was very nice with comfortable beds.Staff was very friendly and helpful atmosphere very calm.Very nice view and extremly central location. I missed bath because I expected it (it was in descrip tion and photos) but otherwise very nice. A few holes in the tovels but otherwise not problematic. Elevator made problematic noises thats why I rather avoided it.,7.9
Location and staff! Always on hand to help :) Not Applicable,10
Nice breakfast.  Good location. Quiet and comfortable room. Very handy teapot and tea bags. ,9.2
Incredible location.Staff were friendly.  Pillows for your beds are cushions leading to a very uncomfortable sleep.Theyre having renovation works but we were not told beforehand at any time.Noisy from all the renovation works.We felt like we were in the way of the workmen and unsure if the kitchen was still operational. ,7.1
The location was very central. The inclusive breakfast offered a reasonable choice of breads pastries cheese and meats. The coffee was very good with a choice of different strengths and decaf. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Only had a kettle in room with tea.,8
The location is TOP When I took a shower the water ran into the room The carpet was all wet They gave us another room on the 2nd floor which was ok but unfortunately they didnt compensate it they acted as this was normal.,6.3
Staff were very helpful and the location of hotel was very central It was hot and air conditoner need beside air fan,7.5
minute away @ Grand-Place & other attractions.. tiny bathroom.,8.3
Fantastic location. Good value for money. Friendly and helpful staff. ,9.2
Really great value in the best location of Brussels. Nothing fancy but does the job for a short stay in Brussels. ,10
The hotel is very close to tourist attractions everything is at your front doorstep or at least a short walk away The hotel staff were helpful and friendly the room was very clean and spacious ,10
Fancy charming exotic warm comfortable big fancy shower  Very small room even smaller toilet. Fancy but not very functional design.Super small toilet sink no hungers for towels no space what so ever in the bathroom. Bedroom campy. ,7.9
The location is excellent it is a very clean hotel and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Check in and checkout experiences were very positive and we also got a lot of help when we needed it (inc directions etc.) ,9.6
Location Uncomfortable bed No coffee in the room  Poor WiFi,5.8
Good location.  Loccitane de provence shower gel! There was nowhere in the bathroom where you could put things - no hook for towels or clothes no surface for washbag nothing! That doesnt have to cost much but nobody seems to have thought about how people acually use the bathroom.,6.3
Lovely hotel right in the centre of Brussels great location. Nice decor and very clean rooms. Had a great sleep here it was so quiet despite it being located right in the city centre. Loccitaine toiletries was a nice touch.  Nothing negative really except we had to keep asking for tea bags and milk each day for our room. But apart from that it was faultless! ,9.6
Staff Cleanliness and location The single room was eccessively tiny,7
great location and amazing staff. The Dansaert hotel is very clean and bed are comfortable. Our room was quiet. shower is not so comfortable due to the loss of water through the door that makes wet the floor.  the sink is too little :(,10
Very good room clean spacious and comfortable. The lobby was under renovation which although did not impact our trip it was a bit off-putting when we arrived as did not know how this would impact the room. Some warning of the renovation would have been appreciated. Thankfully the renovations did not impact the room.,8.8
Friendly and very helpful Staff. Water pressure of the shower wasnt that great.. but I think they fixed it.,9.2
Location is super  The toilet soap Shampo and body shower  The water pressure in the toilet is super  The staff is friendly and helpful The toilet wash basi is too small including its drainage  The toilet ceiling was having some fungus  No enough space to put your luggage  There were always hair of ladies on the bed even after cleaning! No air conditionin  The value of money comparing to quality of the room was not good  No uniform for the hotel staff  No view form the room you see the emergency Steel stairs  When you remove the card from the power activitaion it immediately cut off which wont allow you to exit the room and its risky as you see Nothing,5.4
Fantastic location to go visit the city centre. Easy access to rooms with elevator to help with big bag. ,8
Great location super nice staff.  It was pretty hot and our room only had a portable air conditioning. I believe that might be troublesome in the peaks of summer.,8.3
 Room was so small that it is not possible to consider it as a room..,6.3
Great staff and a great location Taxi service from the airport a bit pricey,9.6
The hotel is very nice.. located not far from the main square.. they are undergoing renovations in the main lobby etc. But the room its self has everything you need clean and comfy.. the position of the hotel makes you question what Brussels looks like but its actually not as bad as you first think and its beauty grows on you.. lots of little restaurants around the hotel.. if youve travelled by car theres a Q-Park just up the road from the hotel.. ,9.6
The location of this hotel is brilliant - 5 mins walk from the Grand Place and a lot of popular tourist spots like Manekin-Pis chocolate museum and famous bars. There is also a metro/tram station less than 5 minutes walk away where you can travel to some places a little further out. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was a nice size modern and very clean. The only bad thing about the hotel is that its on a busy street with a lot of bars and is noisy throughout the night.,9.2
everything  friendly reception staff a bit too noisy since the room was on the first floor .,8
Location is superb service is of high quality excellent value for money Reserved confirmed and paid for room with large double bed and was given room with two single beds adjacent to each other.,9.2
The room is cozy and clean though a little small The ground floor now is under renovation and its not really comfortable. But the stuff is very friendly and helpful. There are no racks in the bathroom,9.2
The room was very comfortable and clean. Great location near the city center. The staff was really friendly and helpful. ,10
Room was excellent size. Lovely staff they were amazing and so helpful. Fantastic location. Room was great value considering we went at xmas and the location. If I was going to Brussels again I would stay here most likely. We asked for two separate beds and they give us a double bed even though we booked it far in advance. Lucky we are friends but not ideal. No fridge for our drinks. But overall not much bad to say was happy with my find.,9
Rooms were good location was perfect. Location is great since I was very close to everything of interest. Staff are extremely helpful and helped with all my queries. Single room doesnt have a safe and beneath the bed in my room was extremely dusty. Noise from the road at night makes it very difficult to sleep. Beds arent comfortable.,7.1
The location was close to most sites. Very close to McDonalds which was good for a quick breakfast. We arrived at a time when they were totally renovating the lobby. They were painting the walls and the floor was down to the cement. Would not have stayed here if I had known. Though the rooms were not effected it still felt uncomfortable with having no sitting area and feeling like you are in a middle of a construction site instead of a relaxing holiday. Would have appreciated knowing this.,5
Good location comfortable rooms good breakfast ,8
Simple but with everthing you need a bit noisy because the hotel is close to night clubs/pubs,7
Shower was good. Room was hot and stuffy.  No real ventilation.  No AC (granted it was a heat wave) and fan provided was useless.,7.1
The hotel is in a great location staff very friendly and the room was lovely with a fab shower and balconies overlooking the bustling streets!  It was a little noisy at night.,10
helpfull Staff perfect localisation in center of the city No air condition a little noisy street,8.8
Location is really good. Near to many restaurants & metro. Cost of breakfast is really high. There is a off smell inside the room when we entered. But after staying in it for a while it wasnt there anymore.,7.1
Location is perfect but thats also the downside Hotelroom at the front is too noisy. Could hardly sleep.,7.1
The room was very nice clean and spacious. Excellent location the staff was very nice and helpful good breakfast. I would recommend it. There was no storage space (no shelf/cupboard/space around the sink) in the bathroom just sink toilet and shower but it was clean.  No balcony as advertised.,8
Location was great and the stuff were good. I would recommend the location. Firstly the beds mattress was soo bad u will suffer while sleeping. Secondly  noises outside were soo annoying specially during the day if u would like to have a nap. Thirdly during our stay which was 3 nights no one changed our bed sheets and pillows and it was dirty and need to be changed.,6.7
The staff were so lovely and friendly.We had a flood in bathroom and lots of extra towels were provided.Tbey gave us nice clean quiet room No air conditioning.It was 35/36 degrees.Felt suffocated.No fridge in room but Lidl supermarket very close,8.8
Pleasant and spacious rooms very good breakfast kind staff. Great surprise the rooms were ready before check in time! In the nearby there are works in the street and might be noisy from time to time.,8
Very good location near to the Grand Palace and historical part of the city.  Parking deck in almost 300 m from the hotel. Rooms were clean and useful. Breakfast was also enough for a hotel like this.  We can come to this hotel for our next stay in Brussels. Noisy neighborhood during the night but it is acceptable at the city center on weekends.,8.8
in the center of Bruxelles 2 min walking from Grand Place the rooms are clean and confortable although not large at the first floor on the main road was a little noisy,8.3
Good location comfortable bed free baby crib on request no air conditioning - may be critical in hot summer,7.5
no aircondition in room no view from room very small sink in bathroom,6.7
Staff makes you feel well come. Very attentive. rooms and corridor are small but the rooms are still comfortable.,7.9
Design at the ground floor Had to change room as the door didnt close noise from the street had to wait a long time for the stuff when wanted to check-out.,6
The location was amazing 5 minutes to the Central Square The room was tiny even for a single room.  The walls were dirty it looked like someone had spilled tea/coffee down the walls.  I had not been notified before arrival that the hotel was being renovated the whole downstairs was a mess and I had originally booked to have breakfast included but was not told before hand that this would not be possible because there was no kitchen or dining room!,5
Location No breakfast as promised room wasnt ready until 1930.Paid full price they shouldve given a discount. ,5
The room is cleam The hotel was in repair process my expectation was not god he room is very hot it needs air conditioning,6.3
 Even for a single room it was a little on the small side. But enough for a comfortable sleep.,7
very central location close to metro station tiny bathroom,7
Location Bad hotel. Bad service! First problems with the doors keycard had to go up 2 times before receptionist believed us. Then no light in the bathroom. Unable to fix..so to toilet in the dark. Compensation was free breakfast. Next morning no water on top floor clearly a pressure problem new receptionist had no cloe new problem never had complaints. Then he wanted us to pay for breakfast :(  Im not a complainer but this was bad! Do not get fooled by rating..hotel without a soul and nobody who takes responability for it.,2
Rooms are clean and modern. Good location easy walking distance to shops and Grand Place. Close to transport services and the Eurostar station is less than ten minutes by car. Staff were very helpful and apologetic about the renovations/lack of breakfast. The rooms dont have aircon so we were given a standing fan that basically swirled hot air around. The rooms facing the street are quite noisy for all the bars and pubs surrounding the hotel. The room rate included breakfast which we were told could not be provided due to renovations at the property. Pillows are awful.,6.7
Lovely hotel very well located. Comfortable room with all necessary facilities. The staff were all lovely and helpful. The location is perfect.  The noise from the neighbouring club at the weekend however the staff provided earplugs which did the trick. ,9.2
Staff were lovely & location was great There was no coffee making facilities in the room only tea. Bathroom was cold in comparison to the bedroom,9.6
Fabulous city centre location secure parking. A lovely property. I liked it all.,10
Location is great. 3-5 minutes from the gate 1 minute from the ramparts. Spacious apartment. Friendly hosts. the boiler across the road which goes off like a rocket at random time during the night! very open plan facilities are unusual.,9.6
Excellent hosts  went the extra mile to make our stay perfect ,10
Accommodation good and the location was excellent. They didnt find the sauna till the last day and didnt know that towels werent included. Also got a parking ticket outside as they werent told that they needed to put a pass in the car.,7.5
Location was excellent easy walking distance to fantastic bars restaurants meniem gate museum and as a bonus a very secure car park. Could of supplied towels otherwise everything was great,8.3
Location was excellent. The second bedroom beds were not described accuretaly on Booking.com ,7.9
The location was amazing very handy and the parking facilities were extremely good. ,10
Very good location a short drive to Bruge centre quiet area a lovely house. ,10
Location place very charming. Clean and very well equiped. The weather was incredible hot during those days therefore the apartment was really hot. AC is there but not working properly. It was like a sauna.,7.9
Great location and good communication with host. Some issues with unpleasant odours in parts of the house. Opening windows to let it air out helped a lot. Staircase to loft has no balustrade along one side and a significant drop off - poses a safety issue for small children. Otherwise clean and very comfortable.,8.3
Location and views are amazing. Very spacious and clean. We would love to come back. Easy parking for the bikes just outside the appartment. Free public parking for the car is 300m away. We could temporarily use the fee-paying parking right next to the apparment to get our suitcases. The appartment is in need a some (very) minor repairs which didnt bother us much. We had to clean kitchen-ware before use as previous visitors hadnt kept them clean enough but it was no big deal. The appartment has a dishwasher and tablets were provided.,10
Beautifully furnished very comfortable lovely host  ,10
Ligging accommodatie Alles was prima in orde,9.2
De Gouden Kop was comfortable for our family of five with plenty of space.  This would be a great place to stay for an extended period of time as it had a well equipped kitchen.  There are also a number of restaurants nearby though we didnt explore them on this trip. ,9.6
Friendly staff excellent continental breakfast.  Beds very comfortable the room and hotel lovely and warm.  The shower room is huge.  The panoramic view from the balcony is wonderful.  Bar and lounge facilities are welcoming.  Just 10 minutes drive from Ypres.  Out on its own in the wonderful Belgium countryside very quiet and relaxing. Ample car parking.  Excellent Wi-fi. About one mile from Dranouter a village noted for its music. ,10
Courteous Staff Great bathroom Great views parking excellent food ,10
Rooms were perfect and generously sized. Bathroom was also roomy.  Hotel was very clean and modern. Breakfast was wonderful with some of the best pastries weve ever had.  Nice extra was the upstairs verandah we could sit out on.  Views of rolling countryside for miles around. Very dog friendly which is essential for us. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. All good,9.6
Great staff all helpful A single toaster is not enough for so many people,8.3
Excellent locationfriendly staff and great value for money. ,10
Very good hotel I the process of being updated rooms could do with a little TLC just to bring them up to standard and electrics in room need attention. All in all very good value for money and in a lovely spot ,8.8
Lovely people great bar great restaurant great large rooms free parking would be great for walks in the warmer weather My bathroom door needed fixing hangs off the hinge,10
Design & decor very nicely thought of throughout the whole propertyComfortable bedsGreat pool and sauna facility to use 24/7Nice and quiet surroundingsVery good breakfast Nothing,10
 ,10
Excellent facilities. The room were excellent and beautiful. Very comfortable. Very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent breakfast. Good location.  Personal attention. Briljant B&B. Better than other hotels in area for same price. ,10
Yes its very good and relax place Nothing,10
nice place to stay! Friendly staff spacious garden with cozy indoor swimming poor deserve your money and visit! Nothing,10
Very Welcoming Hostess wunderfull wellness facilities very clean complex and very responsive. In our case we arrived at 03.00am and we got a tour around the buildings. ,10
The beautiful environment and the wonderful hospitality for welcoming me although it was almost midnight. Great breakfast and beautiful talks early morning. Greetings Mark All is perfect and well organized,10
The room was pretty good and the breakfast was ok. The parking is on the small village square and if you arrive late all spots will be occupied by locals. Upon arrival we found the main entrance locked and a sign requested us to call by phone if you have one for staff. We managed to locate a back door where we found an employee who also spoke English. There was also some mixup so the bed wasnt made this was eventually fixed. After leaving we realized that we had been charged EUR 20 more per night (3 nights) than agreed in the reservation. Unfortunately we didnt have the reservation papers available when paying but that probably had changed nothing as the person only spoke Dutch/Flemish and we dont.,5.4
De Pastorie was excellent. Very very clean. Nice terrace. Nice location ,9
The staff were friendly.  The breakfast was really good. ,10
Homemade breakfast..from products from De Pastorie All people was amazing .. ,10
If you are looking for a place to relax with great walking and bicycle paths this is the place.  The place is quiet and very close to the city.  The breakfast is exceptional and there is a cafe at the hotel just to relax.  Downtown is just 15 minutes away as well as other small towns.  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  Free parking breakfast and internet. Everything was great.,10
The owner was a very nice lady. The breakfast was amazing. I would not recommend this place. On the pictures it looked really great but I did not feel comfortable inside the room. The room was large but not cosy. To reach the toilet I had to pass a hall and two doors. Somehow I was given a barrier-free room even though the hotel did not seem to be booked out. Right outside the hotel there was a cemetery and absolutely no light in the surrounding. It was very scary to come back to the hotel late evening. It was also very hard to find a place initially as Google Maps does not show the address correctly. Had the price been half of what it actually costed it would have been ok but for this price one can find better places in Belgium in my experience.,3
Abience n super friendly staff Nothing,9
Lovely helpful and flexible owners spacious and clean premises great value for money.  Its extremely handy to have a fully equipped kitchen in the chalet (its like a granny flat).  I dont think many other accommodations can offer that in the same area.  We will definitely come back and stay longer next time. ,10
The room is in a self contained building at the rear of the Owners house. It is a delightful room and fully equipped with everything essential and an awful lot more! There is an excellent Chinese restaurant 3 minutes away by bicycle and a good supermarket 10 minutes away. The pleasant town is a little further but has numerous shops restaurants and cafes. Id also like to say how helpful friendly and all round nice the Owners are. I was cycling along a route associated with 1940 Prisoners of War and the Owner is both interested in history (across the centuries) and cycling so it was really hard to leave next day! Nothing!,9.6
This hotel room is a cozy small independent house located in the beautiful small garden. There is lots of nature around here. The hotel is located in the typical rural area of the Flemish region and it is convenient to visit famous Belgian destinations from here. I spent very quiet and peaceful time from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. In the morning I enjoyed clear sunshine from the skylight (window in the roof). The owners madam and her husband are so kind. The breakfast was excellent. ,9.2
 A large spacious apartment delightful owners. A pleasure. ,10
Greta was very friendly polite and very helpful Just the Coffe,9.2
I really enjoyed my stay at De Zon. The house is nice and offers you all you need. It lies in a quiet neighbourhood but in a good distance to some great belgian cities. The owners are really friendly and i enjoyed to chat with them. I feld at Home during my short stay. ,10
Very nice clean apartment and very friendly owners. ,9.2
Very welcoming and beautiful accommodation. The shower was excellent. Our room was up four flights of stairs so it would have been nice to have tea/ coffee facilities in the room!,10
Patrica is a very nice man he picked me up at the railwaystation. ,10
The location is near the city center with lot of restaurants within walking distance as well as a free parking lot under 150 m walk. ,10
All good  and Patrick does the best 7 minute boiled eggs! :-) No hanging space for suits or shirts.,10
Very nice house! The host is a very friendly gentlemen :) The kitchen has all the stuff one needs for cooking. Probably some time ago it was possible to smoke inside because we could smell it in the corridor and at the stairs. But it was not that terrible :),9.2
The view to the river from the room The dinning room a bit dark. I would rather to have the blinds open in the morning during breakfast,9.6
The breakfast was very delicious. The location was also good. ,10
Room was big and very comfortable. The hotel close to public transport. I have a bad experience with this hotel. I booked Non-refundable room. All other hotels was charged the total price of the reservation. But this hotel didnt. On the second day of our arrival at noon we found out that they took money from our card and didnt ask us. It was our last money on the card. I was going to pay cash.  Because of that in Amsterdam we could not book online tickets to several places and had to pay more and wait in the queue. But the worst thing was when we found out that the tickets to the Van Gogh museum can only be buy online. My wife really wanted to enter the museum. There were NO Wi-Fi at all. The carpet was dirty in our room. Far from city center.,6.3
Good location close to public transport and to the highway. It takes 10-15 minutes to drive to the city center. Excellent parking garage with key code access cost is 15$ per day. They send you instructions to retrieve the access code to the room which is quite straightforward - we arrived late at night which was no problem.  Staff was very friendly and helpful every time we interacted with them. Huge bathtub albeit very low water pressure - took forever to fill up The room could have been cleaner. Not that it was outright dirty but there were several spots in the bathroom that were missed in the cleaning process. The carpet in our room was old and had several stains. The furnishing seemed somewhat dated. In my opinion the room could use a refurbishing then it would be perfect.,7.5
Ambience and location along with cleaniness All okay,10
Receptionist guy was very friendly and helped us about the situation about the bad experience One of the rooms was so stinky. It smelled really heavy and bad. Also radiator did not work also.Even the weather is cold we needed to open the windows because of the smell. Dont rent the room 209 especially ,4.2
Staff at the reception is very friendly. Helped me with late check-in and explained everything very well. Although the location is out of the central area the metro station is very close. There is free parking space which is a plus.The room is spacious well equipped and with great natural lights.  The carpet in the room need some deep cleaning.,8.3
all was fine except the wifi wifi didnt work,8
Friendly hosts. Quiet neighborhood. Good connection to other parts of the city. ,8
Location was excellent since I needed to be at the Diamant Building which is just across from the street. Spacious apartment well-equipped kitchen. Having coffee pads provided was excellent. Apartment worn down smelled of cigarette smoke. Mechanical noises from within the building (guess the elevator). Could not access the parking garage unable to reach the host by phone (busy signal phone number in the lobby was out of service) so had to street park. Extensive construction is going on on Bd. Reyers so hard to get to the facility.,6.3
Very welcoming and helpful staff at the reception large and clean room technologically advanced (keypad instead of conventional keys or cards) ,9.6
Quick service and very clean place. Definitely recommended to anyone. None,9
The apartment was comfy and clean. Modern. The personal in reception really helpful. You dont need to collect keys the doors works with a code you get by mail. It was really easy. The code changes with every guest so nobody is going to enter in your apartment. The location is good near Diamant metro station. I needed to change the apartment after my second day because the microwave didnt work and there wasnt any casserole in the apartment to cook pasta for example. I stay in an apartment because I want to cook my own meals and a casserole and a functioning microwave is something that I looking for in an apartment. The good part is the personal in reception who help me without hesitation.,7
The location was very convenient for my business meetings. ,7.9
Clean quiet free parking because of roadworks decent breakfast spacious room  bed and shower OK Bed springs were a bit tired roadworks make access a bit fussy,9.6
The location is excellent. Very friendly staff who like to meet with your needs. We asked for three additional pillows and we got them easily. The pillow are not of a very good quality. I would recommend to replace them.,8.3
It was big clean very good Very soft bed and I just have 80 kg. Mattresses were free so I slided it everytime.. Due that thare was big gap between the mattresses. ,7.5
The rooms were spacious and exceeded expectations the hosts accommodating to requests. Relaxed atmosphere. Cleanliness could have been better.,7.9
Location was great easy to park underneath host very friendly. Not having Keys is a great idea. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Hate to say it as its really great but I think a few things need maintenace.  The door handle to the bathroom fell off the toilet lid fell off and the flush panel fell off.  There was no shower screen in room 507 and in 503 I think the bath was put in the wrong way round.  it didnt make sense but it wasnt a major problem,9.2
Man at the reception was very friendly and went out of his way to be helpful. I was there for a week and would have appreciated a little more guidance on how to deal with practical issues like where to put garbage location of the washing machines.,10
 Room is great! I like the code system to open the door.,10
Well equipped room with comfortable bed and desk large enough to work. I liked how spacious is the room and the large window overlooking the road.  Staff was prompt and helpful when I needed a bottle opener. Perfect location for work visits to this part of the city. Easy to get in and out from the airport with a direct bus connection. My third time there and I will go back next time I am in Brussels. All fine up to my expectations,10
Super friendly staff very good location the size o the apartment was just right. ,9.4
All what u need and good views and quiet at least on 5th floor garden side Facilities somewhat run down but then the price is very reasonable,8
I liked the simple way that you can get into the rooms and into to hotel. Also I liked the fact that even there wasnt mentioned on Booking there was breakfast included. It wasnt a very fancy breakfast but it was simple croissant & coffee and thats all I need in the morning. There wasnt really anything I didnt like. It quite met my initial expectations perfectly.  It was clean cozy there was unexpected food involved..,7.1
Very good communication with personell Soft bad not too clean room remote controller for TV is used from DVD player - very bad control,7.1
Price spacious room easy booking. Carpets curtains and furniture rather worn out.,7
Very well equipped apartment with everything a business traveller could need. Very clean and comfortable. Convenient location for Brussels Centre and Zaventum There was an issue with the car parking space which was resolved very well with staff but was initially problematic. I was very grateful for the support provided by the duty staff.,8
The on line contact/helpfulness The carpet,7.1
Even though the aparthotel is located outside the City centre it is easy to reach by bus or by Metro. The man at the reception was polite and very helpful. Two of the four towels seemed to be used and not changed. The washbasin has cracks the furniture has some split-offs and the tarpet has abrasions. It would be okay if the price would have been adequate. The building is lokated at a very frequented road. The apartments facing to the road are accordingly noisy.,6.7
Convenient location everything was as expected. Breakfast wasnt included,7.5
Clean large room good place kitchen in the room very friendly personnel acceptable price Not all lamps are operative in the bathroom (may be I didnt find the additional switch) I didnt find tee spoon. ,9
Nice and clean solution for business travelllers very  closed to bluepoint conference centre. ,8
Self-check-in went fine despite late arrival. The staff was friendly and I got to grab some croissants for my travel location was good for my purposes. Rooms was very spacious with a big comfortable bed. I spent two nights in the hotel.  However one of the windows facing the busy road outside was broken and did not close all the way. The staff tried to fix it to no avail.  A major construction site and busy traffic outside made sleeping from 07:00 onward impossible (despite being used to noise and having ear plugs). Heavy machinery has been on site for months and the construction work will continue for some time. That the management still asks for $120- per night (breakfast not included and on weekdays) is unacceptable.,6
It was close to my meeting place. The room temperature was not adjustable and I had to open the window which resulted in a loud noise as there is heavy construction work going on closely.,6.7
The bed was very comfortable. The WiFi was good. The kitchen equipment was modern and the kitchen was well stocked. ,8
Nice clean place very good service spacious room. Works ongoing next to the property make access a bit difficult.,9.2
Large and clean room handy position good WIFI easily reachable very good price Cold room and no possibility to switch on the heating system,9
The bathroom is nice and clean and the bed is comfortable. The carpets were stained and the halls had an odd smell.,7.9
two free coffees in the room The carpet was dirty. The mattress was thin and not comfortable. Difficult to find the internet password. Complicated procedure entering the room (less than 1 second to open the door after entering password),4.6
very fast feedback Its not working microwave.,8
Loved everything else The remote didnt work,8
I really enjoyed staying there. The highway is nearby which occurs some noise when you open the window.,8
Everything:) Staff was unbeleivably helpful and efficient garden space is just great the rooms are very well equipped new furniture a lot of space. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recomnend this aparthotel! Some clients had problems with access after working hours of the reception.,9.6
We loved our room .. Was beyond our expectations the view was excellent. The green and everything. Our overall stay was excellent. I would recommend this accomodation. The meals can be improved,9.2
Nice building nice location Very small room noise made by the castle front door every time someone is using it,7.9
The surroundings and the classic styles. I didnt like housekeeping on my door at 9AM. The roads around the chateau were horrible to drive on. I missed a minibar/refrigerator.,8.8
The Chateau was in a great location all the staff were very friendly and spoke good English. Both the evening meal and breakfast were very nice and there was a good selection for both. Would happily visit again. ,9.6
The grounds the feeling of quietness and freedom to walk around our relax on garden chairs scattered here and there. Swimming pool and spa area a bit overcrowded (it was a very hot weekend) but everywhere else very pleasant and quiet. Fantastic cafeteria terrace but food pretty grim and overpriced.,9
Hotel was really nice - the old castle was charming. Area was beautiful and peaceful. staff (one receptionist) was not very competent. I had feeling that they dont care about client and that they are not very flexible. I guess it is minus in all big hotels.,7.9
Fantastic property and facilities staff were super friendly. Our room didnt have a lot of natural light so it didnt really make us feel like spending much time there.,8
View and Spa are excellent  Friendly staff Poorly maintained property and room. A bit more effort and the price for a room would be acceptable.,7
middle of nowhere but a gem once you find it.fantastic experience ,9.2
The views from the property are amazing!  There is nothing like just sitting around looking at the chateau you are staying in.  It is gorgeous to look at..  There are also plenty of things to do on the property if you have time.  I.E. pool bikes pool tables walking paths and etc.  The room we had was OK and the breakfast in the morning was just enough. The price was a tad steep..  The photos are beautiful on the website but we got one of the meh rooms.  The room had no view of anything and was tucked away on the back side of our respective building.  Dinner was also something else..  As with the price of the room dinner was expensive.  It also took over an hour for us to get our meal because it seemed like they were not ready for the crowd of folks that showed up.  ,7
The whole area around is gorgeous! Unique place. Smelled like smoke as the neighbours were smoking outside next to our door.,8
Amazing views and quiet surroundings.Lounge area was tastefully decorated. Casual and homely yet private and luxurious. Staff at lobby were efficient and cheerful. Rooms were also better than expectations. The rates during my stay in October were irresistable. A no brainer decision compared to others in the area.  Parking area was a slight walk away in exchange for a nice clear chateau grounds. And some effort is required to bring luggage up & down narrow stairs leading to room especially in the smaller building. Just pointing out small inconveniences that dont really spoil the wonderful stay there. ,9.2
Having a bedroom at the front of the hotel which is at the top of a small hill we had a lovely view over the park around the hotel and surrounding woods. Especially the lounge was very cosy relaxed and comfortable wonderful to quietly read something with a nice drink at your side.   Good breakfast with ample choice. The interior of the (large) bedroom was good but not really cosy and the lights were a bit too bright to my taste.,8.8
Amazing location. Lots of activities even in corona times No bathrobes available on our arrival. One out if two saunas broken. Take away food on disposable dishes,9
Great location and nice staff. The chateau is absolutely stunning and the wellness area has a nice lounging area and pool. There was no airconditioning in the room just a fan. With 30 C degrees outside it was not very pleasant to be in the room. There is no minibar in the room so we couldnt keep our drinks and food cold. The dinner in the restaurant was OK but not worth the price. Besides this we had a nice stay!,7
The location and the Chateau itself were impressive nice park around and very comfortable inside. Regretfully it was only a brief stop-over for us! Parking is a bit away from the main entrance so dont carry too much luggage with you.. Breakfast is not really cheap.,9.2
The surroundings are fabulous pure nature quiet fresh air. The staff nice enough but my impression was they started with their job the day before. Not very good at managing the small details which makes a tourist feel like on a holiday.  Under our rooms windows at 7:00 in the morning some workers straded their job and wasnt quite the planned time for a holiday wake-up.  Towels not so white,6.3
Grounds location are a peaceful and a romantic settings. For the price I felt like the rooms could be better equipped such as aircon and a bar fridge.,7.5
The space and the facilities Lack of elevator,9
Breakfast was great! A bit more snacks available at the bar. Coffeemaker in the room!,9.6
Loved the Restaurant ! Best food ever ! Our room was in an building with thin walls and one small window in our room. Not a great sensation,5
The location in the middle of nature Very old fashioned rooms dirty carpet dirty armchair basic bathroom,4.6
The place was being refurbed and the staff really were very un helpful We were a group of 6 people and wanted two twin rooms and one double we got a double plus another double and a triple room but really was not what we asked for . the bar was open and took the staff twenty mins to serve us for one drink then a new staff member  arrived and he would not serve us until after 0000 and we were wanting a beer at 1144 joke. never again use this place looks stunning and run by idiots loads not good the bathroom in the triple room was dirty and not suitable for three people,4.2
The setting was perfect. DIY breakfast,8.3
Beautiful scenery! The castle with his rooms on a sunny hill are lovely and relaxing as well is the brand new spa. Great for a weekend out. Unfortunately the restaurant isnt open except on Friday and Saturday and the bar is very unoccupied as well so besides you might getting hungry the hotel misses some lively athmosphere. ,7.9
The breakfast was perfect! Ideal location and great views. Iv never seen such a good service very friendly and professional staff. ,10
Excellent breakfast. No tea/ coffee making facilities in the bedroom.,6.7
Lovely place to stay with lots of charm. Great balance of activities. Staff very kind and competent. The family lodging was like a dormitory without any charm in contrast to the rest of the place. Just 4 beds little furniture and the ceiling beams at 1.65 m high were like obstacles. So quality for price no what we expected.,8
Fluid check-in easy to find very nice and clean place well maintained. professional service. Kitchen (take away in these days) was excellent ! Superb region ! relatively small room painted dark khaki green. Makes you think the walls are coming at you. We were located in the Ecuries. Id suggest a light colour when rpainting the wall. Except for this remark tidy clean bathroom very ok. I suppose its also a matter of taste..Of course in COVID period we had to spend more time than we liked in our room during evenings..,8
One of most beautiful views..hope 2 be there soon ......,10
Location was fantastic so scenic really beautiful grounds and building. We were in the newer building the was no lift up to first floor so the cases had to go up the stairs no issue for us however others may need help.,10
The outside appearance of the Chateau is very nice. The staff are friendly. No kettle for water boilingParking is not convenient.,7.5
The view from the window was great. It was quiet hot inside the room. Old fashioned lobby and everything around makes you as you are travelling back in time. The location is perfect. The restaurant was closed had to look around for food in the area (there was a list with nearby restaurants given by the personel). The room was not so spacy as the rooms in the pictures. Expensive breakfast offer..,8.8
The use of the outdoor spa pool sauna and mini golf was a real upside!  The room was very clean and staff were very friendly and helpful.   We enjoyed our stay but found the meals in the rooms uncomfortable. I understand its covid and very much appreciated the option to buy food from the hotel and take it to our rooms. However I was in a room with 3 people that only had 1 chair and a bed on the ground so it was awkward to eat in our beds. ,8
Nice room quiet location The set up of the castle is not castle-like but really fit for mass-tourism.,6.3
I think this place has got everything you need to just chill/relax and leave your day to day tensions behind.Loved it and will be back in near future  Just the problem with the stroller of our new born. There were some stairs to get to our room. And the floor made a lot of crackling noise when we walked and babys sleep was disturbed.,9
The hotel staff were all great and v helpful. We liked the furnishings smart relaxed without being stuffy or pretentious. The only downside unfortunately was in the dining room the cheese board was left unprotected from the flies landing on all the lovely cheeses. Perhaps a little note to remind guests to replace the cover after use would be a nice touch.,10
We liked the view and the BBQ they arranged due to covid restrictions. The pool and that whole area was great and theres a lot of great hiking trips you can do in the area. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was a bit basic.The last night of our stay the restaurant reopened after being closed for several months due to covid and the evening was a bit of an unorganized chaos. We understand that it was all new and werent too upset but we really hope for future guests that theyll get better organized,9
Location perfection ! Misleading pictures on the site about how the rooms are.. i paid for a superior room but at the check in i got a another room different from the picture and the crazy and vague explanation from the staff was that the picture was a presentation of the best room and the rooms on the pictures were all reserved so what i got was still a good room but very different from the picture. That was a shame!! ,6.7
Great location nice rooms and we love the fresh breakfast. ,9.6
Buffet at the restaurant was really tasty! The location was stunning very nice for hiking! The offer at breakfast was really poor. Theres no possibility to have a drink or a small snack during the day.,8
The location is amazing and the bed was so comfortable There was no do not disturb cartel for the door,9.6
Beautiful place and friendly people Bedding should be upgraded. Not comfortable..,8
Localization. Views and inside the nature. ,9.6
During the short overnight stay we couldnt explore a lot but hotel is in a very nice location old building with views and well established gardens. A lot of parking spaces available. We have booked a twin room but on arrival we have received a twin room but the beds where put together and only one sheet was placed on both of them. We couldnt separate it completely to feel comfy. I have pointed out that there will be 2 male colleagues travelling but probably they didnt take this into consideration. Very expensive breakfast. Room was tiny.,8.3
We came to spend a long weekend here with our friends with teenager kids. There are so many facilities here that we had a fantastic time here without moving out of the domain. Even on a rainy cold day we could enjoy the heated pool and the sauna and the kids could choose from the many board games offered by the domain. All Corona- related measures are in place I felt secure during our stay.  The location of our room was not ideal next to the staffs room who started the day early and were a bit noisy. ,9
Gorgeous property to get away from everything. Beautiful view from our room.  Large rooms with high ceilings. Small but adequate bathroom. Outlet by bed for charging cell phone. Plenty of light with overhead and bedside lamps. Buffet dinner was wonderful.  Choose your own wine from their cellar. Outdoor and indoor seating.  Lovely bar on the main floor again with indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of different lounges for hangin I got out.  Pool and foosball table.  Totally recommend. No A/C but huge windows and they provide a fan.,10
Very nice room with a balcony and lovely view.  Evening meal was fantastic!  You pay a set price and help yourself to the quality starters mains and desserts.  Good choice of wines and very good breakfast.  Plenty of parking. ,9.2
 Service from the reception difficulties with double booking calling to check out while I had one more night double charged .. ,6.7
Dinner was fantastic. The manner of selecting wine was marvellous like Ive never seen before. Dining and breakfast staff were marvellous. Facilities seemed shabby. Car park has a gravel surface and is some way from the building. Furniture was poor quality and looked like much of it came from a flat-pack shop a long time ago ie shaky and poor quality. Carpet in the dining room was filthy. We asked specifically for a room that we could access without stairs but the first room offered not only had access via stairs but had no handrail. After some hassle the room was changed.,5.8
Location is simply perfect. Installations are ideal with plenty of activities to do. Everything was clean and comfortable and working perfectly. To recommend. Well come back Staff non too friendly but functional.In our last night restaurant was closed according to them to *organize the menu for the summer. Its ridiculous that you closed the restaurant on Jul 1st for that reason. They provided a list with alternative restaurants in the area but all of them were closed so not a good last night dinner ,9
Fantastic location and lovely chateau. Great pool area and surrounded by beautiful parc. The rooms in the chateau are smelly and small. Wasnt very clean. Breakfast during Covid 19 is a bag with 2 pistolets and some sides - 14$.,7
I loved the views and the history. This property was very nice however the staff were not the most pleasant. One new bartender was very nice however and so was the check in desk guy. Other than that they basically ignored me when I had questions for them. Also no ac at this hotel. But thats not their fault its part of the experience. I just wish the staff was a little kinder to make the experience better.,5.8
Fabulous location. Beautiful architecture. No tea or coffee making facility in room. Breakfast ridiculously expensive at $20 per person. A gorgeous chateaux. The little castle is an interesting building let down by bland characterless rooms.,8.3
Many facilities were included such as bikes games the spa area mini golf and much more. The breakfast was alright nothing special. They made sure the stay was as comfortable as possible with the current restrictions so they set up a shop to meet all your needs. The room we were staying in was newly renovated but sadly completely lacked any character what so ever. As if someone tried to put together a room by picking different styles from an interior magazine trying to make it look cool and trendy but completely messing up by mixing everything. I wish the room had the atmosphere of the old buildings we were staying in. Also the road to exit the grounds was badly damaged.,8
Perfect location  for relaxation. Friendly staffs . Just like in a fairytale . Couldnt mention anything bad,10
The gentleman on reception was great and made us very welcoming will go back sometime Nothing,10
Everting was great also the food and wine in the restaurant! ,10
The hotel is very unique being that it was an old mansion. The path walks and the view is beautiful. The breakfast was wonderful and is farm-to-table style. The rooms do not seem to be kept up. There was a smell of mold/humidity in some of the hotel buildings. This causes a lot of issues for people with allergies. The internet was also pretty weak which is not helpful to guests. ,6.3
Pretty chateau Rooms and corridors painted dark green everything very dark and depressing. Very poor lighting in rooms. car park long way from buildings and poorly lit food very over priced. Not enough staff on reception,4.6
Everything was perfect!! It would be handy to have a pump to pump up the tires of the mountain bikes.,9.6
Great breakfast. Great location lovely walks etc Hallways dark and many steps.  Decoration dark and weird. Car park is a long walk from reception. No evening dining option when we visited so had to drive to find a suitable venue,6.7
Very beautiful location beautiful cosy bar & friendly staff. Breakfast was average not that many choices in the buffet but it was ok. We didnt really liked the fact that we had to bake our eggs ourselves on a baking plate at the buffet. For the price of the breakfast we expected a little more..,9.2
Everything else No air conditioningAn iron is not allowed in the apartmentNo napkins ,9.6
The location and staff were perfect The kettle and other kitchen items were not very cleaned and I had to wash them prior using them.,9
Location & value for money Difficult to enter the building after 8.00pl.,9.6
Everything was really ok. The advantage for me is that it is situated right at the end of the motorway so that I can avoid traffic jams. It has a garage and the Metro station is just some minutes walk away. ,10
Great property that offers you a break from the traditional hotel. You get a fully furnished flat in a great building and ideally located. I liked everything about this property and there was nothing that I did not like.  I had an issue with the internet but after calling the operator someone came to my room in less than 3 minutes to resolve the issue.,10
The accueil was perfect friendly and professional. The premises are very convenient close to public transport impeccably clean. The staff is very friendly and professional redy to assist you whenever you need. Absolutely nothing please continue working as you do,10
everything was perfect. we did not take breakfast. rooms are large and clean well fitted. nice and quiet. ,9.2
Excellent and very large room in a quiet location. A little bit far away from downtown and very limited breakfast,8.8
 Not clear to me about breakfast. I was screamed by old woman in French that I took her sit,7.9
Had a problem with the dishwasher but it was dealt with as quickly as possible given that it was the weekend. Staff very friendly but a fluent knowledge of french from any future visitors would be useful! English or Vlaams was limited to individual personnel.,10
Located in one of my favourite part of Brussels close to metro station shopping mall and magic Foret de Soignes. The flat is spacious kitchen well equipped and with a comfy bed. The staff is very service oriented. I would definitely choose it for longer stays where I could profit of the swimming pool and gym room. It is unclear if it is possible,8.8
The neighborhood was very quiet and the size of the apartment was huge. The location is a bit far from the city centre.,7.9
Quiet place close to public transport. Good parking and access to motorways. Nice residents ,10
Everything. I will definitely use the accommodation next time in BRU ,10
Very little English spoken by front desk staff but apart from that apartment was spacious in a great location. Very easy to get in and out of. Nothing.,9.2
The place is good: very quiet not far from metro and only 15 minutes by metro to the center. Also the rooms are big enough. It is strange that in the rooms there are no cloths- and towelracks. One must go to the bedroom in order to hang the overcoat in the wardrobe and after washing the hands in the toilet to go to the bathroom for the towel. Where have you found so small wash basin for the toilet?,8.3
 Not enough information for tourists. But generally excellent,9.6
On arrival they are very helpful during collecting the property keys. Nothing Important (the reception are not available in late nights what about if i lost my room keys!),9.6
Perfect! Two rooms with bathroom and a kitchen annex. Perfectly clean with nice cosmetics provided. a small sponge or brush in the kitchen would be nice,10
Nice and clean apartment in close proximity to public transport. -,9
Great home from home where I can relax during business trips. Ideally located for me as it is only a short walk from my office. Would recommend. ,10
Very nice personell good service clean room spacey elevators great price! Breakfast could be more selective.,9.6
Comfortable stay. Breakfast is included in the price of the room. Free wifi. It was a good overall experience. ,8
Great value for money. Staff is fine but a bit special Belarussian style. For example cleaning crew wouldnt change my towels but argue about it. All in all very good for its price Asking me for my room number when I borrowed a sewing needle not changing towels and sheets on demand. Small things that as a European customer are a bit difficult to understand.,7.5
Great value for money! Large clean room comfortable bed. I have already booked the same hotel for my next stay! ,9.6
Great breakfast spacious room big mall nearby good sound-proofing fridge in the room. Cigarette smell in the hall. No freezer in the fridge.,9
My second stay at this hotel. All was great again. I really recommend East Time Hotel for other travelers. Thank you! ,9.6
Value for money. Decent size room. . Could easy fit extra bed in room for family. Good location easy access to transport. There was a hole in bed clothes there were worn. Kettle in room would be nice to be able to make tea coffee.. Maybe remove  dressing table as one in two rooms deff fit extra single bed in.,7.9
It is a good place and the room size is good as well as the bathroom overlooking the main street including the supermarket and shops. It is good for the room price area and cleanliness and there is a bus station near it as well as the most important characteristic of the reception staff very well in dealing with customers and nice ,7
The hotel is conveniently located close to bus and trolleybus stops as well as next to big supermarket. The room was quite big and modern and the staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfasts could be a little better with bigger choice.,8.8
The hotel is nice nothing special but comfortable bedding small cozy room fresh furniture. Good location just next to a hypermarket and to a gas station  that works 24/7 where you can buy tea coffee and pastries any time. Good breakfasts. The area around the hotel is green there is a river and lots of greenery.In general  I enjoyed my stay. No teapot and fridge in the room. No porter service. Nobody will assist you with your luggage. Uncomfortable to carry bags through small  stairs on the way to the elevator. ,7
Rooms are really nice - clean spacious enough furniture everything you may need. Clean hotel. Breakfast was good. The hotel is near the main road easy to access by car parking lot in front of hotel. Good Value for money.  It took very long to check in and there were too many for breakfast so not everyone could fit in (we had to wait for over an hour to get a table). Probably doesnt happen too often but that was the case when we stayed there,8.8
Quiet location comfy room. Breakfast included with good coffee. Great value. A bit far from the centre but accessible by Trolley Bus 3 or 30.,8.8
Breakfast very simple could be better. Breakfast table was not clean and all days the same food - could be changed. Rooms big fridge included.,7.5
Everything is very nice‚ù§ In Minsk all the best,10
Size and cleanliness of the room and toilet.It had all necessary functionalities. Nice touch of water and fruit as welcome.Modern and nice decoration in a nice Belgian house off Ambiorix Square very close to EU institutions.The host lady was very nice and waiting for me at the time agreed.  Not 24 h reception although you can arrange time of arrival.It is not possible to pay with credit card on arrival/departure (only cash or bank transfer)WiFi not fully reliable for video conferencesThe shower door was not well built so there were some water leaks on the bathroom floor (as it had no windows it would not dry),8.3
Sara is very kind and the rooms were very clean in a very good location. It was very small and not so comfortable.,8.3
Nice neighborhood Very nearby to Schuman area. Place is cozy and comfortable. Got all necessary basic amenities. Room was big enough and mattress was very comfortable.  ,10
Small cosy room with all that I need except for a very good light in bathroom for make up Nothing,8.3
Great location close to main EU buildings. Very friendly owner and staff. ,10
Excellent location and the ration between good service and reasonable price. Everything was O.K.,8.8
I could not imagine better place for living! And amazing District ,10
Very well situated. Big sized room with a super comfortable bed and a massive shower. Very nice plus with a small kitchen available for the guests. Loved our stay and will definitely come back. The wifi was not very strong.,10
Everything! We like it a lot and the service was great ,9.6
A cozy and large garden room with kitchenette and shower. Everything worked well. The staircase up to the building and in particular the stairs to the garden might be a problem for someone with mobility limitations not for me though. If you are ok with some stairs an excellent choice.,9.6
Very kind owners excellent breakfast super clean. Very small room but I was very kindly warned of the fact in advance. Enough and comfortable for one person.,9.6
The host Sara is friendly and welcoming the room was made available for me earlier than planned. The budget single room is indeed small but has everything you may need. Great location for meetings at EU institutions in lovely area. ,9.6
Great location very tasty meals and very helpful personnel! Everything was perfect.,10
She was kind and the room was comfortable. ,9.6
It was very clean and confortable!! Good position in a nice area!! It exceeded my expectations!! ,9
Everything perfect. The room was very clean comfortable and quite. The building is newly renovated rooms furniture and bathrooms are absolutely new. Nice kitchen and common areas which can be used by all guests free of charge. Extremely easy and fast check-in/ check-out the access instructions received in advance via e-mail were very clear and detailed. Excellent value for money I would certainly recommend this place. ,10
The location is perfect. I had a room facing the street and it was nevertheless very calm. Contact with the staff worked very smoothly by email. I would recommend this structure! ,9
Very clean and modern nice neighbourhood I realised too late that there was a room next to the kitchen so I felt bad about not making less noise when I had my breakfast at 7 AM.,8
breakfast was great room super clean and everything as expected nothing to say,8
The eurocitadin is well located in a quiet area close to the center. Everything was all brand new when we arrived. Well organised and clean. Well most defenitely would recommand the stay! /,9.2
Its easy trendy clean and comfortable. The location near all the hipster bars and restaurants is top rate yet situated in a tranquille street  ,10
The bathroom heating panel doesnt work. When I asked where is the turn on/off button they replied is behind the panel but I looked everywhere there is no such button. They didnt bother to follow up with me. No real person to provide the service,6.7
Great location quiet comfortable and something of an oasis amidst a busy week of meetings!  The hosts were poor on their communication. I sent several emails about a query relating to early drop off of a bag but received no response. ,9.2
Good location parking availability a comfortable size for 4 persons. Not easy access from the underground car parking to the apartment bathroom not equipped with any shelves no hand soap in the bathroom nothing to hang your coat at the entrance to the appartment,7
Location in the EU district. Well connected to Airport and main stations. Clean and spacious. Just had one small towel. Street a bit noisy.,7.5
Nice place and location . I didnt see the host but we contacted via WhatsApp. ,7.9
No fuss access - key was availble in the locker ,8
spacious nice location reasonable price. little bit cold,8
Clean and fast check in.Easy to find and good location. ,10
Very clean and new. Only one towel ! Rather cold in the room,8.8
 TV service doesnt work properly. I would need the original bill to cover the cost of the stay.,8
Location Instructions to get into the building were misleading nobody told me the front door was unlocked but the huge handle bar was broken do it was impossible to get into the lobby for the keys,6.7
the bed comfortable the couch average very clean. location very good  close to metro quiet area need better couch more comfortable . one tower for every day and little bigger bath towers.,9.2
Very close to all UE institutions and also close to Schuman metro and train station. Cosy with very nice hosts. Recommend! ,9
The bed was very comfortable. There is a good organic grocer just next door. The metro is 200m away. There were a couple of different emails about how to pick up the keys from a mailbox which were confusing. I tried to check in at 23:30 after a very long day of meetings and travel and couldnt get in nor reach someone by phone for the first 30 minutes. I nearly checked in at a hotel down the street. Eventually someone picked up the phone and explained the new mailbox number and code so I finally checked in just after midnight.,6.7
Very good location in the middle of Euro Quarter I couldn¬¥t find the free WiFi or the wireless passwords,8
Convenient location. Easy to access. Very clean and well equipped. Bed not very comfortable. I dont like foam! Also nowhere to put toiletries in the bathroom and only the one mirror in the bathroom.,7.9
Location was very good. The apartment was spacious and had everything I needed including an iron and a hair dryer! The television didnt work properly. It kept switching off itself after couple of hours and the remote control didnt work properly. There was one curtain that did not come down and there was a building on the opposite side so I had to climb on the chair to manually unroll/roll the curtain. Bathroom floor was not cleaned properly. It was a bit cold in the apartment - when I tried to turn up the heating the heaters made so much noise (which did not stop after waiting) so I had to turn it back down.,8
Accommodation was good but probably overkill for 1 person staying 1 night as no time to use kitchen amenities. I went next door (hotel) for dinner which was good inexpensive and convenient. Instructions for key collection on arrival were easy to follow. Location was perfect for my stay. Cleaning charge for apartment when 1 person staying 1 night is expensive and makes price close to nearby 4 star hotels.,8
Location Some coffee in the room would have been good.,7
Great location big comfortable bed. Kitchen well equipped.  Easy check-in.  No extra toilet paper. Shower that overflowed. Kitchen stove not well cleaned. ,10
Great location cosy apartment. My requests were always considered by the host. Enjoyed it a lot. ,9
close to the highwaylarge parking for trucksClose to a gas station the staff does not speak English!,6
The person at hotel the trucs engines on the parking always on all of the night,9.6
the ease of access to the motorway the staff were unhelpful in the extreme  the breakfast was meagre and had no resemblance whatsoever to the pictures on Booking.com,4
very good location  to stop on the way to Germany or Italy The Staff was horrid  continental breakfast was meagre   no restaurant nearby so we had dinner expensive and bed,4
Conveniently located in a truck stop on a motorway junction. Clean bed linen. Breakfast just ok with good coffee. Bathroom stank of stale cigarette smoke - had to sleep with the window open when it was snowing outside - unacceptable to a non-smoker that the hotel has not rectified this. Rooms basic and small in the basement - bed is ok but not particularly comfortable. Looks superficially clean but actually is not. Check in is at the cafeteria till - no staff present at this till on arrival. Stood around waiting - then told that I must book via the internet before I could check in even though I had already booked via this website. This is a truck stop motel and not a hotel. Not recommended for anyone other than truckers.,4
clear Very noisy. On booking.com this appeared as a hotel while in reality it is a motel for truckdrivers. No cup in the room to drink some water.,4.6
Very handy for the motorway typical continental breakfast. Signage to the hotel could be better a wider range of TV channels would be an advantage as would coffee-making facilities.,7
Very clean and good. Would surely to stay again ,9
Location Staff high cost health and safety- fire escape screwed shut food- breakfast quality ,5.4
Convenient to park next to highway. There is no sign outside which says Hotel or Exit29. Staff unfriendly receptionist refuses to understand any other language than french and gave me s filthy look cause i tried to comunicate in english. Pillows are a horror rooms cold and bare. Remote for TV didnt had batteries. Heating switches off at night so rooms are icecold in the morning. Dont go there again.,5.4
Location. Breakfast was very basic no selection not even an egg!!!  Coffee was not very nice. For the price of the accommodation it was really very poor. The meals in the evening were also basic and quite expensive for the content. Definitely wouldnt stop here again.,5.8
Great breakfast and good location I couldnt open the window so the room was very stuffy. And the TV was 30 years old.,6.3
Staff are friendly.  It is not like a regular hotel since it is in a truck parking and the costumers are almost truck drivers so it is different environment but not everyone would like this There was bad smell in room section. Staff do not know English. Also it is exactly located at the heart of a crowded truck parking so you should consider this too,6.7
Nothing never seen a worse hotel. the staff only spoke french there is no wifi in the rooms the room was freezing cold and really dirty the dinner and breakfast were disgusting the reception was also the restaurant cashier so if there are customers eating you have to wait. really not recommended,1
Excellent location and very tasteful interieur Peaceful and  close to nature Closest restaurant had closed Monday-Wednesday Details like quite complicated griill/micro and missing  pan to steak,10
Clean comfortable spacious very well located for access to Bruges Brussels Ghent and the coast. Very helpful hosts whenever we had problems. A better variety of saucepans would have been helpful the road was slightly noisier than we expected there were a surprising number of mosquitoes.,9.2
The beds were very comfy my kids really enjoyed the stay they wanted to come back again myself for the next holidays I will like to come back again that county side is so quiet I would like to recommend this to friends and family as well. What I didnt like just a lot of flies in the property I do understand  because we were at the county side. But its was so good,10
We really enjoyed the stay here. A carefully refurbished property in a beautiful area. All necessary things was provided. Clean and comfortable beds. Nice view from the balcony! ,10
Very peaceful.. Nice view across field. Great shower. Comfy beds. Character building. Lots of utensils.. Nice courtyard. Helpful staff.. Close to good cycling routes. No dvd player.. WiFi didnt work.. Could only fit two on the sofa,8.8
We loved everything. It was peaceful beautiful both inside and out and comfortable. We were very very impressed and will be very likely to go back for more cycling. We loved everything,10
Nice location to go MTBing. The apartment was clean and well equipped. The pillows were not very comfortable,9
I loved the old building it had a lot of character. The location was great only a few minutes away from the city center. The beds were very comfy. The bathroom wasnt that great. It was hard to take a shower and not have water dripping on the floor. Dripping is an understatement. Also the bathroom was in front of the room and it was not possible to close the door to the outside. We where by our selfs but if there are a lot of guest I woud not like the idea someone could just run into your bathroom.,8
Great host I can highly recommend this Hotel! Perfect service .. ,10
Its a wonderful house located in front of the Saint-Martin church. The outside doesnt say much but once inside its a real gem. The rooms are well decorated and are very comfortable. The view of Liege from the garden is amazing. Even if located very close to the city center (5min walking distance) be prepared to walk uphill or climb hundreds of stairs. But its worth it -),10
Very cosy tastefully restored old house. The room was excellent silent good privacy nice and clean bathroom.. Very friendly staff excellent breakfast (optioneel 15$ pp extra). Highly recommended The only very small remark is that the bed was a bit hard for our taste but still good.,9.6
Great location and wonderful amenities. We were warmly welcomed and the breakfast was Excellent. The apartment was beautiful and super comfortable with a full kitchen. I would definitely recommend! ,10
Place was so pretty and the design was perfect! Pictures dont do the justice ,10
Beautifully restored Belgian mansion decorated to a very high standard.  Nothing not to like.,10
The owner could not have been more hospitable everything about the stay was of the highest quality we could not have been happier. ,10
Excellent decoration and very comfortable rooms very friendly People nice home made breakfast. ,9.6
Warm and helpful hosts (thanks Veronique for the guidance about places to visit and to dine at). Very nicely restored house with tasteful decoration. Room was large and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. We really enjoyed our visit. Nothing,10
The whole house (apartment and breakfast room) was great. A newly renovated old-style house clean and quiet. The breakfast was good but it could be a bit improved. On the other hand everything was fresh and the owners were very welcoming. The house was located within walking distance of the old city centre which was great for taking . ,9
Very nice hosts who made sure everything during our stay was on pointBeautiful room (double room with shower)Nice courtyardAlthough we live in Belgium well come back! ,10
The host offered us a choice of 3 rooms when we arrived. The rooms are beautiful & the shower was fabulous! The host very helpfully gave us a map & list of restaurants.  The guest house is very close to the centre of Liege & we were lucky enough to get a free parking space almost opposite. Although there was a stand-alone AC in the sitting area there wasnt one in the bedroom. Being so warm we slept with the windows open but the traffic noise disrupted our sleep.,9
Friendly ownersSpaceous room/suiteWell equipped.Thanks for your hospitality ! ,10
Breakfast excellent. The room was absolutely exquisite. ,10
From the moment you enter from the rather plain street  you will be surprised by the romantic and stylish courtyard. My welcome by the hosts was warm and accommodating and  I was amazed by their excellent taste in furniture and decoration - all very stylish quiet tones and with great eye for detail. As opposed to the bigger chain hotels it is very personal and cared for which also goes for the very comfortable rooms. I was sorry I was there for business because it would have been the perfect romantic get-away. But then Im sure to go back. ,9
The room was as depicted on the pictures very neat and tidy. Nothing.,10
The room is very beautiful and luxurious. Nice location and very well equipped kitchen. Loved the fact they had extra pillows i request i usually ask in hotels. The shower is very unhandy for tall people.,8
Lovely stay in the city center of Liege! Very comfortable and spacious room. The hosts were very kind and welcoming and even provided a small private dining room where we could have our take-away dinner and breakfast in the morning very thoughtful and convenient during these covid-times. Definitely recommend this place!!  ,9
Perfect and beautiful !Wonderful room with excellent and comfortable bed !Breakfast is just perfect ! ,9.2
very comfortable (good heating) nothing,8
Host dinner and breakfast very good. Location easily reachable and nice.  Very big rooms good comfort and bed. ,8
Very nice owners ! They were very supportive. The room was nicely decorated. Lovely old farmhouse  For 120 euro we would expect - tea and coffee for free in the room not just a kettle- fresh towels. The towels really did smell bad so we used ours. - a decent bed and pillow: it was just very old and used too much. - more reasonable prices  of the little restaurant required. It is not worth it to eat there at the moment. - overall totally overpriced ,6
Great Dinner and BreakfastCozy room Good value for moneyInternational vibeRoom ready before checkin ,9.2
The location is nice and quiet! They tried a bit of dutch what is great of them. Everyone is friendly! They serve a big breakfast (incl.) and 3-course diner ($20/p.p.). An upgrade to the bed and pillow would be needed.,9
The private help in the owners car to pickup my forgotten bike-ricksack 8 km away. The many mosquitos in the bedroom,8
I liked the food the facility manager was very friendly very calm surrounding good water pressure in the bathroom. I didnt like squeaky floor the noise from neighbors and the dirt in the grout in the bathroom.,8
A family-run place in the middle of the village. Very nice rooms. Good sauna. The food was simple but tasty. The place has its own rhythm (because it is all run by basically one person) but if you can adapt you will have a good time.,8
Great Breakfast starview from the bed!  Nice cosy room with 2 large bedrooms and private bathroom.  Good location. Friendly staff Bit pricy.,8
Cute rooms with nice deco very welcoming owner and delicious breakfast with local products. Very calm stay. Sadly we only stayed one night and couldnt try the crepes and ice cream that are also sold in the same place in the afternoon.. ,9
It was as promised. The rooms were cosy the breakfast excellent. And the host was very friendly and accommodating.  ,8
A unique lodging experience. It was in a very quiet location in a small village surrounded by farmland and farm animals. The hostess although she didnt speak English was very nice and accommodating. Our room was very large and nicely decorated. Breakfast each morning was very good and the locally made preserves were wonderful I especially enjoyed the confiture de lait. The top floor room got a little hot as we were there during a heat wave.,9.2
The location was great and the room was extremely comfortable and clean. They also provided us with an earlier than normal breakfast which was very much appreciated. ,10
People and good were good Old skool country hospitality,9
We stayed in room no 5 which has 2 rooms and great views. Breakfast is decent and owner is fantastic. Location too is great though one may struggle to find food nearby though owner do prepare dinner. Do not want to be picky its a nice place for a short vacation.,9
Friendly and helpful staff. Location in the centre of town. Excellent breakfast. Comfortable room. Nothing to not like.,9.6
The hotel receptionist is very friendly and helpful. Otherwise the breakfast and coffee  was good On the other side the quality of wc is not as expected. Water is leaking and needs some renovation. We expect also the room with a large bed but there were two small beds laid together therefore the lying was not so comfortable.,8
The location of Hotel Flandria is perfect. Very near to the old center of the beautiful city of Gent.  Its a five minute walk from the parking (EUR 15 p/n) and maybe 2 minutes walking from the old churches. At check-in the staff was very friendly The accomodation is not very clean smells funny and there was a lot of dust in our room. We booked a room with a large 2 pers. bed but instead we got a room with separate beds. The separate shower looked old a bit dirty and not very comfortable.,6.3
Location was great and it is very good value for money. Staff was very nice and efficient. Breakfast should have more options it is a bit simple,8
The location is perfect - 3-5 minutes to the very center and still quite and peace. The staff is very friendly and helpful. No soundproofing. Rooms are in need of renovation.,7.5
Spacious bedroom view of the cathedral fabulous location but still very quiet The shower in the ensuite needed you to hold the attachment to make it point in the right direction,7.5
Given the exceptional difficult circumstances the staff were fantastic. ,8
Very nice staff! The rooms are not very friendly designed more like a hostel not a hotel.,7.1
Amazing location right next to the city center. Very friendly staff (italian woman and the guy who checked us in - dont remember their names). Very good breakfast. Big room and comfortable beds. Everything was great!  The bathtub/ shower could be better.,9.6
The room was a humid and not ventilated well as a result theres a bad smell of the carpet and in the bathroom some smell of moisture Nice hotel in the historical center. Simple but very atmospheric breakfasts (cozy interior and music in the buffet).,8
The description of the Hotel is very correct. No frills hotel in the historic centre of Ghent and the right price when compared to other hotels in the centre of Ghent. We had a rather spacious room with bathroom at ground floor the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast is basic but still ok. Everyone was very helpful and our room was quiet and cosy after turning on the heating. Maybe it requires some TLC.,7
The staff were lovely. The bed was clean and comfy. Hotel ideally situated for centre of Ghent. Parking a problem and most roads leading to hotel are now one-way which my sat-nav had no idea about. The hotel itself is in a very poor condition. It is clearly very old with lots of wonky floors and a winding staircase which is difficult to get suitcases up but my main complaint was was the state of our room. The decor hasnt been touched in a very long time and the electrics - well - I was so worried we would be electrocuted. The toilet cistern was not attached to the wall and the whole place felt grubby.,7.1
The locatio is excellent!The sataff is extremely polite and helpful!! Very old fashioned needs complete renovatio!!!Too pricey!!!!,5
cosy breakfast corner. very friensly staff . Really quiet room. Superb location near the historical center of the city Light in badroom could not be switched off manually. Ventilation turned on without any reason a few times and light  went out automatically after a few minutes while showering,8
Fab breakfast and really cozy breakfast/bar roomPersonal touch with maps etc ,9
Excellent room (23) and breakfast I like the old-fashioned and cosy low-level profile of this hotel. Very friendly staff feeling as being home. ,8
Very singular and pleasant atmosphere. Very nice and helpful staff. Ideal location. Great value for money. The room I was in would need a refresher (but then the value for money in this part of town is great.),8
Very good location gave me good memories ,8.8
Almost in the city centre. Easy to find. Toilet is too small in first floor if the bathroom is busy you should go down or up for toilets.,8.8
Short walk from the centre. Lovely retro breakfast room and very generous breakfast. Very comfortable bed. Friendly hosts! Great value for money. Small rooms but cannot really complain about that with the price for the night!,7.5
Good service and kind staff. Swift reply to e-mails. Relaxing atmosphere. -,9.6
Receptionist attention to detail extremely welcoming and helpful 10/10 for this. Great location. Cosy in quiet street very near to all sights. Not much we didnt like to be honest pretty good in all areas. ,8
A cutebasic hotel. Liked it a lot. Wish there were more simple budget places like this. Breakfast was good. A very positive experience Trying to find it do to misunderstanding. Took tram one as instructed then followed instructions. Only problem the large church at kornmarkt stop is not the cathedral but a very impressive CHURCH so wandered around in circles for quite some time. The hotel is near the CATHEDRAL,10
Excellent location. Great breakfast. Both our friends and I found bed bugs and reported to reception. The staff did not seem that interested or concerned. They did move our friend and gave a part refund. However we had to wait round all day to get this sorted.,5.5
Room comfortable breakfast good. No tea-making facilities in the room.,7.5
The girl on reception was extremely pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was really good and fresh coffee all included. Ideal location. The building and rooms a little rough around the edges but compared with the value one cant really complain.,7.9
The rooms are rather old-fashioned and appear to be undergoing a rolling refurbishment. Rather reminiscent of French hotels circa 1980. However the place is charming the staff are lovely and it is spotlessly clean. It is also very well-located just a few minutes from the centre of Gent. ,9.2
Good location friendly people and nice breakfast. The room we were in could use a little upgrade as everything was rather old.,8
It was quirky and the staff were friendly The room had major damp issues,6.3
Amazing comfortable bed lovely cosy room with a great view accross the city. Hotel is ideally located for everything you want to see in Gent. Breakfast was delicious! The decor in the hallways is a bit tatty but this is a minor thing,8.8
Comfortable beds attentive staff great delicious breakfast convenient location Can be a bit noisy-no carpets to absorb noise,9.6
The room was very clean and bathroom . the bed was beautifully made. they give us shower & shampoo gel and soup. We liked the long windows and there was a beautiful romantic view from our window. The room was warm and cozy warm blankets en soft pillow. Breakfast was amazing! I drink Hot chocolate milk and ate toast with cheese and ham. i enjoyed the stay. Also very close to the tourist places. We couldnt sleep very well because of other guests coming in the hotel in the late night. That made a lot of noise. We hear the noise of the stairs everytime. Room is not sound-proof.,8.3
Breakfast was quite nice. Served in a separate room warm fresh bread rolls and simple garments. If you do not expect anything fancy (which you shouldnt when paying this price) youll have quite a nice experience. For a one star hotel its actually quite nice. Plastic on the beds. Easy to remove though and housekeeping got the message so they did not put it on again when I left.,8.3
Centrally located friendly multi lingual staff nice selection of drinks and snacks at breakfast clean fair price for Ghent. Travelled with my 70yr old grandad stairs are steep and winding. Loose light fittings and plug sockets in room.,8.3
The beds were really comfortable and its in the centre walking distance to all the things you want to see/do in Ghent A bedside table (with charging point) for every bed would be nice,8.8
Very nice location. Very kind and good staff and facilities. Rooms have a shared bathroom,10
Service was excellent! The gentleman at the reception was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area. He even printen my boarding pass and left it on my bed. Ill definitely visit again. Not applicable.,8
Seriously super friendly and helpful staff especially Charlotte! Good location. Ive found photos here a bit misleading - the room and bathroom didnt look that nice at all. Housekeeping could be improved and the sheets which are thorn should be thrown away.. Also the walls and doors are very thin - we could hear some guys rambling talking loudly and slamming doors at 5:30 am when walking back and forth between the (shared I guess) bathroom and room(s) for like an hour..  There were some rain paddles on the rooftop/terrace so we kept the windows closed during the day to keep mosquitos away but housekeepers left them open every time which let plenty of mosquitos inside. Kind of annoying :(,6.7
Great value Small beds but comfortable,8.5
the staff were more than friendly and only too willing to accommodate our requests. The breakfast was typical continental   with ample for every one. The climb to the top but that was unavoidable but did not detract from the overall experiance of the hotel,8.3
The staff was very nice the room was small but comfortable. Everything was very clean. The breakfast was very good. The shared bathroom was very nice. The wifi worked very well. The bed and pillow were not very comfortable and the window of my room was broken and did not close well. I told in reception and they came to look at it but nobody fixed it. I also missed some more hangers in the wardrobe. There was only one.,8.3
 Online I selected a double bed but we got 2 single beds pushed together with separate matresses.,4.6
Nice location in the very center of the city. Room is tidy staff is really friendly and helpful. Also we could store our luggage both before check-in and after check-out. The breakfast is good. There is no radiator in the bathroom so it may be quite cold in winter.,8
Very good location Thin walls a bit run down,7.1
Location was very central and in a quiet area. The breakfast was limited but adequate. Quite a lot of noise from the plumbing.,7.5
 Bathroom didnt have heater so it was too cold.,7
Friendly staff very happy to speak English. Comfortable rooms. Good breakfast buffet. Also there was a bar including hot drinks manned by the Reception staff. One of our rooms even had a view of the Cathedral! As in many hotels unfortunately there were no tea/ coffee making facilities in rooms and we do like a cuppa! But the fact that there was a reasonably priced bar including hot drinks meant that it wasnt too bad!,9.5
 Our hotel room did not have running water. Even after multiple reports nothing was done about this.,4.6
Breakfast location Room was warm very clean The bathroom,8.8
Roomy bathroom. Excellent staff. Great location. Nice breakfast. No kettle in room.,9.2
The staff were very good.  Could leave my bag before check in.  Was immediately offered maps and tour brochures.Had a single roim shared bathroom.  The bathroom was spotless.Breakfast was quite good.Room was cozy bed was comfy and warm.Location was very good quite close to the city main areas for tourists. ,10
Excellent location and price. A VERY minor thing. No coffee making facilities in room.,8.8
The location is exceptional. Service is friendly and helpful. The tv didnt work. But who cares about tv?,9
Breakfast was good. Staff friendly. Good central position. Size of bedroom. We had room 24. Bathroom and shower need makeover. Shower doors are falling apart. Hotel a nightmare to get to due to new one way systems and no entry signs.,7.5
Very friendly and helpful staff comfortable double bed good WiFi and breakfast good location. Old building with creaky floors (i.e. noisy) bathroom too tiny and the light inside was switching off too often.,6.7
Beautiful vintage hotel! Simple facilities but nice location and friendly people. I loved it! ,8
Good value budget hotel. Receptionist very friendly and helpful. Safe storage for cycles. ,10
Reception was very friendly and offered some useful tips on the local area.  Breakfast was very nice.  WIFI was fast enough to watch TV via my laptop.  The hotel is located close enough to the centre of town to have easy access to restaurants and shops but also located down a quiet road so that there is no noise from traffic. Double-bed was actually 2 singles pushed together - which is a pet hate of mine.  En-suite bathroom needed some repair and smelled of damp.,8
Good central location. Good staff. Good breakfast Despite stating that parking was available..it isnt. We were shown the streets where free parking on a Sunday evening was but it was obvious that you couldnt park there. The streets were too narrow. Where we did park we received a parking ticket at 8pm on a Sunday evening. Talk about keen ! The hotel is more of a hostel than a hotel ,6.3
Close to the centre helpful staff everything worked decent breakfast. A long way to the parking no lift small room.,6.3
Room 19 was clean and the staff moved me to the room when I complained about another room 24 Room 24 had mosquitoes and room was smelly with smoke smell. Shower drain did not work and the door was broken,7.1
The staffs I met were super super nice and really helped a lot. The breakfast was small but great. Moreover the location is also one of the reasons that I highly recommend this hotel.  This is an old building so during my stay when people walked up and down the stairs it was kinda loud at night. ,7.9
Great location-very close to old part of Gent-  room overlooking the cathedral Receptionist was very welcomingExcellent breakfast ,10
Good and friendly staff. Good location. It wasnt clean and safety boxes were broken.,4
Clean comfortable cheap. tea coffee and cookies are included.Fast check in fast check out. Theres no locker. Actually therere lockers but we cant use them because keys were lost.Unstable WiFi.,8.8
Great location clean excellent service (also free laundry) delicious food cooked by a hostess. And on the top - unbeatable value. I stayed at a capsule and loved it. Special appreciation to the lovely hostess Lena (mother of five) who goes above and beyond to make guests happy. ,10
Thanks to manager of Flatcom for service. ,10
The room is very big even with a couch inside.  The kitchen is a little bit small and the hostel has only two bathrooms. Its a bit far from the center. ,7.1
Very good place to stay everthing was clean :)  Staff was very Kindly and helpful  Perfect :),9.2
i like the location and hostel so much clean i like it and staff aslo friendly and polite even lady dont know English but its fine. i rate 10 by 10 nothing,10
Cozy hostel perfect for a short stay with fanatics staff although we cant communicate in English(like most Russian City) their attitude is really good and very helpful!  Atmosphere wasnt like hostel but its alright :)) ,9.2
 Staff unpolite. Guy at check in did not even say hi. Not the place to stay in if you really want to rest. Loud in corridors and people listening music with speakers with no stress. Only 2 bathrooms for so many beds.,3.8
Receptionist lady help you for everything. Thay should arrange the hostel name in English language and this advertisement board glue in front of hostel. ,10
.. Registration is not made. We paid a fine of $ 103 for this reason. Disrespectful staff dirty rooms noise. Very far from the center. A bad hostel . (,1
It was clean enough. The beds are pretty comfy. Not too far away from the subway station (about 10 minutes by foot). A supermarket in the next building (8am-11pm). The stuff was friendly and helpful. Super thin walls you can hear every word if people in the next room are talking in normal voices. No common place to sit and relax. There is only a tiny kitchen with bar stools or you can sit on your bed theres no other option. From what Ive understood there are rarely any travellers among people who stay there - but just people of different age who come to work. This gives the hostel a different vibe from what Im used to.,7.9
 Registration is not made. We paid a fine of $ 103 for this reason. Disrespectful staff dirty rooms noise. Very far from the center. A bad hostel . (,1
I do this evaluation considering the amount paid by the room which was very low. The address was very easy to find but when I arrived in the morning nobody answered the door.. I gave it some time and finally I managed to get in. The receptionist spoke very little English but understood nicely Spanish so we manage to understand each other. The bed was brand new and very comfortable with your own lamp and power plug. At first the room didnt look that nice maybe because it is a bit too crowded. At the end it was good - it was just a bad first impression. Overall an ok hostel.,7.5
The owners were very friendly. We did not realise that the BnB was as remote as it was from the local town.,8
the  friendliness  of  the  hosts  the  location is  perfect for a good night  rest! nothing!,7.9
Very nice people on a very peaceful place ,9.6
Very nice B&B tres sympa. Bed nice and comfy. Good breakfast with homemade jams. Only small details that would make it even better: e.g. have shower Gel in the bathroom rather cool evening + night for my taste and heating not working yet have a free power socket near the nightstand.,9
Comfortable bed  Good shower Everything was satisfactory,8.3
The breakfast was excellent. The owners were very nice and helpful. I missed to have a water cooker in the room.,9.6
Breakfast excellent various breads and croissants fresh from the bakery delicious home made jams various kinds of eggs to choose from freshly squeezed fruit juice cheese and cold meats. And of course freshly brewed coffee and tea! nothing,9
Location is good Breakfast very limited. Some time you need to wait elevators. Room cleaned one time in 2-3 days despite that we cooked in room. Garbage bin was sometimes full. We was forced to buy toilet paper soap and shampoo.,7
The hotel room was excellent in terms of being able to look after yourself.  It had a kitchen with everything you needed including plates cups and cutlery.  Staff were friendly and we got free parking on the grounds. The beds fold up into the wardrobe to make room during the day.  My partner and I slept really well.   The breakfast was fine.  Continental buffet.  Only there one night so didnt use any of the other facilities. The view from the room is of the town.  Would have preferred a sea view but I dont think any of the rooms have that.  There is a ferocious wind that comes off of the sea.  Maybe that is why.  I thought the check in time was a bit late at 4.30pm and the check out time a bit early 10am.,9.2
The location is decent..not great. It is getting run down.  The hotel rooms all face a gas station and the city.  The other side of the building where there are no rooms face the ocean.  Dont be fooled when you reserve a room with a view.  THERE ARE NO ROOMS WITH AN OCEAN VIEW!,5.4
Pool but not the changing room (small cabins) First room we checked in was smoking room as read  in previous comments. Me moved room and baby cot ourselves no staff or lazy. Check out at 10am swimming pool opens at 10 am. So second day you cannot use it. Strategic but no nice. Bistrot/restaurant so and so  Breakfast is average or below but included in the price,5.4
It was near the bathing area and the shops.With a tram stop nearby.you can eat and drink in the hotel for a low price.but good food. A bit dated.but perfect for older people.,8
Loved it friendly staff good size room for 2 ,10
Very close to the beach and center. Playground ok camera ok. But in general expensive The restaurant: people not kind and not helpful. Constantly closed much before indicated in the menu. Pool closing 20 minutes before indicated.,6.3
The property is perfectly located to the old center. We found everything we wanted to do was within walking distance. The apartment is very comfortable and had all the amenities we needed for our Two night stay including a coffee machine. Everything was perfect. Though you need to contribute some coinage if you use the coffee etc. There was a complimentary bottle of wine though.,9.6
The location is absolutely perfect! Carine is a super friendly and helpful host. The flat is clean and spacious. Highly recommended. ,10
Instructions on entering the appartment were perfect. Beds are very comfortable. Very spacious place to enjoy the evenings. Perfect location as the main sites including opera house were at walking distance. Supermarkets and good restraunts are also not far. The stove is missing. To our opinion the lighting in the dining room was not enough to read.,9.2
Great location in a pedestrian area close to main attractions. The bed was comfortable. The property was very clean. Carine did her best to resolve some plumbing problems. Nothing much. A couple of minor things like no toaster and low quality toilet paper. Would have preferred a range of bedding options rather than only a doona.,9.2
Location was great. The flat was really well laid out and comfortable. The facilities were good - dishwasher good cooking areas nice bathroom. Plenty of space in the lounge/dining area. Oven instructions were hard to understand but we worked it out. Stairs were tricky but manageable,9.2
Huge windows allowed lots of fresh air and light when needed. Door code made it easy as we didnt have to mess with keys. Long dining table was great. Could use more outlets. Needs hooks in the bathroom along with a shelf for bath products. One more fan would be nice as well.,9.2
Excellent location but quiet extremely comfortable and beautiful flat. The host has anticipated everything needed . Very easy to use entry process. Good communication from host throughout. ,9.6
Great location modern and clean with excellent kitchen and dining area. Thanks  ,10
It is a beautiful very clean apartment the land lady is very very nice she left us a bottle of rose wine as a wellcome drink it was a nice gesture. The kitchen is basically new perfectly equipped. She explained us everything every information she gave us even before by mail was absolutely correct. We had a very good time there. If I have to say something maybe some air condition could help if the weather is extremely hot so we do not need to open the windows when there is a lot of noise coming from the streets. And a little freezer also would be nice. But these are not really important we had a wonderful stay there.,9.6
Excellent communication from the owner. All the things in the flat worked. The fixtures and fittings were of generally high standard. Very spatious and nicely furnished. Keypad instead of keys makes it easy to split up a group and not worry about getting back in. Not a problem in colder days but the lack of freezer might have been annoying in the summer if one wants ice and icecream. As we were travelling as a couple a sofa rather than just armchairs would have been nice although they were comfortable. These are minor points though as we were out most of the time and the neighbourhood is well stocked with cafes and eateries.,9
Carines place was lovely and homey fully equipped to make you own meals very stylish and comfortable. So many stairs to get to room a little difficult with luggage!,10
Apartment is exactly as the pictures suggest. nice bathroom and good beds. Location is also perfect. no complaints.,10
For Four Flats was perfect for our needs - plenty of room and nicely appointed.  Great location - close to tram stop shopping restaurants and a short walk to the city center.  Communication with owner was excellent from booking through checkout.  Would definitely recommend. ,10
Central location clean well appointed. Loved the Honesty Bar where items like beer nespresso pods and wine were in the flat and we could leave money to reimburse her. She answered all of my emails promptly. Overall a great choice! The only problem was that every night from midnight until 2 or 3 AM many rowdy people would migrate from bar to home. We stayed there 7 nights and it never failed to wake us all up usually multiple times per night. It was better when we shut the windows which cut down on a lot of the noise but it was too hot for us to do that. ,10
Very warm welcome very homely feeling. Everything we needed was there.  ,10
Great place warm and cozy green garden (our dog was verry happy there:) ) friendly hosts good localization Aywaille- beautiful area.For sure we will come back soon :) ,10
The hospitality was overwelming. The house and garden are great. Felt like home. Everything was so nice and clean. For a couple as well for a family with children i recommend Gite les gadlis. The location is perfect everything is near by. When you love the nature and his beauty dont doubt and book. You dont regret! Nothing it was more than we expect. ,9
Getting the key was really easy. The hosts helped us with telling everything about the house. These are the nicest hosts you will ever meet. Amazing people! The house was very clean full of all things you need for your stay and more! The road outside is a bit busy so you hear the cars pass by. But overall weve had great stay! ,9
Location: quite close to the unique site of Niglingspo and to Caves de RemouchampsFlat offering two spacious bedrooms  a fully equipped modern kitchen nice bathroom including even an individual sauna! A terrace with a little garden is there for you as well  Located quite close to the unique site of Niglingspo and to Caves de Remouchamps it is a pity that it is overlooked by a huge aerial bridge part of the E25 highway!,9
Excellent facilities everything like brand new and super clean. Kitchen was just really well equipped. Great place for kids with closed garden and even with some toys. Very nice hosts who live next door. We were nicely surprised with small welcome gifts. All in all a very positive stay :) The only thing we didnt enjoy was the fact hat you could hear cars passing by on the road next to the house.,7
Very clean house and fully equipped. Host provided for us baby equipment. Very kind of them. This is the best appartment accomodation we have ever been to. Extremely reccomended Nothing. All great!!,10
Everything was excellent There was nothing not to like.,10
Perfect location! There was no WiFi available and not enough heating for the cold nights and mornings,7
Loved the tent & the facilities for the kids The smell of the pigs because it was on a pig farm,8.3
Super nice set-up in the tent as much as outside the tent! We loved the beds organisation everything we needed was there lots of playground for the kids animals to feed! It was perfect although we had bad weather. ,9.2
Nice and cheap for family looking to travel. ,8.8
Nice location great to be in peace with kids To pay for the towels  And no soap at the location,8.8
Will be good with kids. The farm setting is relaxing. The tent is well equipped apart from knifes to cut fruit and veg. The breakfast was good just way to much.  The shower. You were either burning or freezing. It never kept the temperature. There are no chairs for outside use although the setting is suppose to be outside. No umbrellas for the extreme sun. We left the tent open which was a mistake and the rain left water marks on the lounge set. It cost me the deposit. So remember even in extreme heat you need to close the tent (it was 37) this means it gets boiling inside the tent for fruit and veg. Therefore the tents are not really ideal in warm summer weather since it is facing west.,6.3
Walking distance to the historical center. Cleaning was not good there wasnt toilet brush. There was no soundproof we can actually hear the next room.,7.5
Nice room. Varied good breakfast Nothing,8
Clean modern bathroom and bedroom Access stairsno lift,9.2
The staff were very helpful the hotel decor was pretty fancy :) the breakfast was delicious for just for just 125 euros. A car parking was provided for 15 euros as well The bed was too small for 2 people maybe the heat didnt help as well which is unusual and no AC (as most of the hotels) ,9.2
It was lovely. Very clean nice staff and comfortable room ,8.3
The hotel has an old charm The location was good for station and not too far to walk in to the main tourist areas Breakfast was ok (maybe a little freshen up of things would have helped) Apart from the member of staff at check in everyone else was very nice.  Just the one member of staff who checked us in. My son is in a wheelchair and on check in she happily just pointed me in the direction of the stairs that go up to the lift. She failed to inform me that if I went a different way there is a ramp we could take to the lift. Very very unhelpful.,8.3
The parking was easy and convenient.  The location was perfect for walking to restaurants the old town and historic sites. The drain in our shower was very slow which resulted in standing water.  When we requested help to fix it the front desk said the would send someone to look at it but no one came.,8.8
Excellent breakfast. Great location 15 minute walk to station or town centre. Friendly staff. The absence of tea/coffee making facilities in room. The communal tea/coffee facility was out of order a couple of times.,8.3
very close to the center sweet nice room ,9
friendly clean and local would reccomend. ,8.8
Very nice hotel in a quiet area parking place available clean nice staff. The room was clean large bathroom nice backyard plenty of chairs and tables to enjoy a warm evening with the friends. ,9.2
Great location and very friendly staff. Good we could use the hotel car park Would have been good to know the car park was not included in the price quoted on booking.com,9.2
Very convenient to the Square and and ideal place for us as we had 8 motorbikes which were parked overnight in secure parking as long as you reservefriendly staff and comfortable rooms highly recommended Nothing,10
A beautiful hotel perfect for what we wanted perfectly situated with very friendly staff. ,9
It was an excellent hotel. The staff where very friendly and accommodation. The rooms where modern clean and stylish. Location was excellent and everything was a less than 10 minute walk away. Added bonus was the beer vending machine in the lobby. Nothing,9
Good location nice staff nice and quiet hotel very clean but simple Didnt like that it smelt a bit or that there wasnt a bar or anything to chill in or have a drink etc,9.6
The breakfasts were very good & the manager was very friendly & sorted out our payment issues quickly. A few more seats where our big family group could have met to sit in the evening.,7.1
Excellent. I would hope to stay there again in the near future. Clean comfortable and only a few minutes walk to the main square. Plenty of venues for all types of food nearby whatever your taste. Secure parking on site was a big bonus. No tea / coffee making facilities in the room and the coffee machine in the hall was not working on the last day. Just a minor thing but these things happen.,9.6
The location is good the room numbers are comfortable. At the end of my stay all the plugs were not working and there was no reaction on this problem from the staff which was a surprise for me.,7.5
Friendly staff and good location It was un clean .poor servicesBreakfast not value for money,5.4
Staff were excellent breakfast was fantasticgreat location lovely room.  Only thing lacking was a bar. Lack of bar thats all.,8.8
The bed was incredibly comfy we slept exceptionally well.  I can also highly recommend long baths in the bathtub - it was really large and a great comfort after a long day of walking in the cold.  The staff was also very helpful and friendful. We had in issue with some of the lights (e.g. the bathroom light kept flickering when you turned it on).,7
We arrived early (10am on the day of check in) and were allowed to park our car safely while we did some sightseeing before checking in. The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. Our room was well suited for out family of three - clean comfortable and quiet. ,10
Close to the centre so parking is easy enough. Nothing really.,7.5
Staff were excellent! Drain flies in bathroom.,10
 Triple room is so small and not suitable for 3 people.,6.3
A lovely spacious room with all the necessary amenities. Really good central location a stones throw from the centre  (T Zand and street leading to Grote Markt and Belfry). No toilet brush.,9
Very close to centre of Bruges and the train station. It has a lift the shower and bath were excellent and staff were helpful. Mini bar would be good.,8.8
The bed was very comfortable and the location was convenient. The person checking me out was very friendly and pleasant. I was meeting family for a surprise for my father. My parents arrived first and the person on the check-in desk completely gave away the surprise and when I arrived told me my parents were already there. Absolutely no regard for guest privacy.  There was mould and chipped paint on most of the windows in the room and bathroom.  I was looking under the bed on checking out in case anything had rolled under and found rubbish belonging I assume to a previous guest.,6.7
The location worked well for us.  only 10 minutes walk to the center of town.  and only 3 minutes from a fantastic outdoor market.  Parking is expensive but at least it is offered.  Hosts were very helpful ,8
Great hotel in a good location at the edge of the centre. Easy walking distance. The hotel was clean comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The family room was big and we opted for breakfast which was a nice selection.  ,9.2
Amazing personnel in the reception desk and the location is very good (walking distance from any major tourist attraction). The breakfast is also very good! There wasnt hot water running in the morning and unfortunately the points earned for having a his and hers sink in the bathroom were lost because they were both broken (one was leaking on the floor and the other was clogged).,9.6
The location is excellent quick walk to the historical center beautiful building. The staff was very kind and polite and accommodated our requests. The room was clean. Theres parking (additional cost) which is convenient. Staff asked if everything was ok showed interested and overall professionalism. Theres an ice and vending machine at reception too.  It wasnt a huge deal for us but my feedback would be that the shower needs improvement. It was stuck in one position so wasnt suitable for taller people it leaked flooding the floor and the drain was really slow so water accumulated up to your ankles (shower is in the bathtub). The staff was happy to give us extra floor mats to help with the leak though that was good. ,8.8
Very helpful staff that let us leave our bags when we arrived early and the day we left whilst we went shopping. Clean rooms with comfortable bed and a good sized bathroom. Charged me twice by accident and not enough tea and coffee for 2 people and didnt have any la your or dairy free milk options.,7.5
Adriana the recepionist was fantastic!!!  ,8
Great location close to the centre. Delicious breakfast to start the day. Very friendly staff. Ill keep this hotel in mind for my next stay in Brugge ,9
Breakfast very tasty Not a large choice of vegan food for breakfast,10
Great location nice rooms at a good price fantastic owners. Found free parking 400 metres away or there is limited parking on site. A very short walk to all the attractions of this great city nearest bars and restaurants about 250 metres Nothing,10
Court yard and reception area. Instructions on how to find the entranceway No area to park outside on a very busy road to get instructions to open parking area door Room had curtains not on the rail Looked shabby The bathroom lights stopped working,7.1
The staff were really helpful for disabled guests they ensured a parking space was available and the room was both suitable and near the car for access. ,9.6
Very good hotel in a quiet but convenient part of Bruges Staff very friendly and helpful. Would stay again. ,9
The receptionist was excellent. Extremely accommodating and good with her English. The changes she altered to allow us to book another room was fantastic. . Would go again. Location was amazing! The only thing was that the superior room wasnt really superior It was a little too hot in the room and small for the price we paid.,8
Its a beautiful hotel close to the city center. Only a few minutes walking and you are there! The staff is really friendly and helpful. All the hotels should have staff like this. For me was excellent. For sure I will stay at the same hotel when I come back. Everything was great. Nothing to complain about.,10
But.. The room was clean and perfect for 3 the bathroom great and route to our room lovely. Great location. Staff friendly The room had too many lights..  Neon . That wouldnt turn off and the bed wasnt very comfy,7.1
Breakfast was delicious and very adequate.  The closeness to the centre of Bruges was an advantage. No kettle & tea making facilities in the room?,8.8
Staff were very helpful  great secure parking and location a  5 minute walk to the centre One of our rooms had no air conditioning and it was impossible to sleep in the heat  although apart from that the room was excellent,8.8
Location.Shower. Pillows are awful. Rooms are not very clean.,5.8
Very friendly and helpful service. Much appreciated help with sorting out a broken slat in the bed (most likely caused from a prior booking and kids jumping on the bed.) I recommend booking the breakfast as this is a good value addition to the stay. ,8.8
Fantastic friendly welcoming staff. Hotel was clean although a little tired however it looks like they are refurbishing the rooms and would stay here again. ,9.2
Location There was no storage or shelving to place your toiletries,7.5
The location was excellent on the inner ring road around the old town. A few local eateries for lunch and dinner but better choice in the centre - a ten minute walk away. Nothing.,8.8
Tasteful furnitured clean Hotel comfortable nice breakfast buffett good Location to explore the City public parking 2 min away ad cheaper than the Hotel parking. the nightstands have lights at the bottom with movement detectors which go on when you leave the bed at night to use the bathroom some people might find that helpful I rather find my way in the dark.,9.6
It was close to the centre of Brugge It smelt like raw sewerage.,5
Fantastic location and very clean rooms. We thoroughly enjoyed the garden terrace. Drinks were only available in the hotel through a vending machine however there was a good little range of drinks. ,9.6
Nice location Very small room with locked windows. I felt like I was staying in a jail. Nice bed clean room uncomfortable pillows. Not as described as a deluxe double room,5.8
location to city center (5 min walk) & to metro/train station (15 min walk) 2 sinks in bathroom windows that open staff very nice & accommodating.! the very strong air freshener in lobby old & dusty bear & floral arrangements sink in our room leaked onto floor in bathroom,9.6
Nice location close to the centerwe stood for 2nights  and we had a nice clean room with bath tub so was perfect to have a moment to relax after a day trip in the city center. ,9.6
no breakfast. location good balcony has not been cleaned for a long time,7.9
I was warmly welcomed by a person who even made the effort to speak a little bit of French who gave me all the necessary information and a map of Bruges. Subsequently very discreet and cordial staff.The room and the bathroom are quite big and clean. I couldnt hear any noise from the road thanks to the double window.  You can hear a lot of noise from the other rooms around the bed is not that spacious.,7.9
The receptionists were very kind and helpful. ,8.8
Full of character. Breakfast was excellent. Staff welcoming and helpful Our room was quite small and the lighting patchy,9.6
The friendliness of the staff and their very personalised approach Nothing in particular,9.2
The hotel is a beautiful protected building. Very close to the centre of Brugge. The bedroom was fantastic very modern bathroom. The bedroom was a good size comfy bed and tasteful decor. The owners and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent plenty of choice. The hotel is absolutely spotless. We had a wonderful stay. Nothing could have been better.,10
I highly recommend this hotel! Stayed for 2 days. Everthing was perfect! ,10
The location being close to the city centre The hotel is way overpriced. They charge a lot for the parking without saying a word about the cheaper bigger parking 1 min away . Weve spotted some mold in the room ( next to the window) and in the bathroom. Not recommended,5.8
The location is good and the room is clean. The staff are also very friendly! ,9.2
Staff were very helpful with directions. We had great fun. The staff helped us secure our cycles.really good stay. Thanks. Phil All was perfect,10
Perfect position at 10 wolking distance from the city centre. Good breakfast Missing regulation of the heater,9.2
Being an old family house it was nice to see so many original features  kept. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. Nothing,9.6
At the end we forgot some important items after checking out but we were informed straight away after leaving the premises and that speaks very well for their honest staff. Very good service. ,7.5
The room was great.But the best part was the staff even they were closing the hotel for the weekend because of the Corona situation they managed to find a place for us to store our luggage while we were exploring the city. Really awesome.  ,10
Good location very kind staff excellent breakfast. ,8
The staff were great- very friendly & accommodating & the room was lovely. The reception was very nice as well. The front of the hotel looked quite old which was a bit off putting upon arrival. It also would have been nice if there was a hotel bar.,7.9
Good selection at breakfast.  Good parking.  Good location. The bathroom was badly designed awkward to get past the toilet into the shower.  The radiator next to the sink was rusty. ,7.5
The staff on the reception desk were very friendly and helpful. The overall impression of the hotel was an old building sympathetically adapted to modern needs. The bed was very comfortable. I as glad that there was a lift. Car parking seemed quite expensive but was very convenient.,8
The bed was comfy and it was a great location to the market etc ,9
The building itself. Great staff. It wasnt clean enough.,8.3
The location The hotel is on a busy one way road with no street parking and they keep the gate to the car park closed. You have to park up the car to get a code to park the car and once you have the code you have to drive all the way round again. They should let you know before hand and maybe send you the code if you have reserved parking before hand.,6.3
Excellent location very near town centre and easy walk to centre. Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast not cheap but plenty of it and a good variety. Not a lot. No mirror in bedroom only in bathroom.,8
Great location for walking to the most popular tour sites and the Markt Center.  Very comfortable room for families. The parking lot is not the greatest.  Its off a Main Street and the entrance is very narrow.  I damaged my vehicle trying to pull into the parking lot.  I would definitely recommend parking offsite.  Additionally the shower was not very clean.  There is hair still in the drain and some of the towels were very badly stained.,6.7
Instant hot water friendly personne. Very small bed. The walls in the stairway are literally falling apart because of mold in the plasterwork.  The doors are super old so you can hear everything on the hallway and viceversa. Also we figured the location was good but the road next to it is very noisy.,6.3
Lovely ambience really friendly helpful staff and convenient parking Nothing,9
Location Carpets getting fitted in main area and walkways with no health and safety in mind. No loo roll in our room,7.9
The room we had was spacious and clean. Our room was quiet - we didnt hear anyone else even though there must have been many other guests (since the parking was full). The parking is secure and on the hotel ground. There was disinfectant available at the entrance and the key was cleaned before receiving it. All was good - cant comment on breakfast as we didnt eat in the hotel.,9
Comfortable property good location at reasonable cost Shower took 10 minutes to receive hot water value for money,8.8
Room very. Well appointed Vendi g machine not cool enough to dispense beer  bottle foamed over and wateg half of it.,10
This is a nice a friendly hotel that I always look to book when visiting Brugge. The hotel isnt large but makes up for it with the location. The hotel does not have a bar but being in the centre it is within a few meters of the city centre so it doesnt need one. There is plenty of choice for breakfast and I particularly enjoyed the fresh pancake machine. ,9.2
Great location Bathroom had a few small things that need to be fixed. Shower head was leaking toilet seat was loose and there was a loose tilenon the floor,5.8
Very friendly Reception parking places at Hotel modern Interieur close to City centre ,10
Location The room had a terrible smell of drains and the air conditioning did not work. We reported this to the receptionist. She said it was the first they had had this reported. However after reading reviews from this hotel it appears that youre a few customers had complained. It was a known problem for the hotel. We were only offered a glass of fizz to say sorry as they could not move us. Our room smelt badly we had to sleep with the window open on a ground floor which was very noisy. Our room was in an annex away from the hotel. The air conditioning did not work. We had a very unpleasant stay and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I believe a glass of fizz was a pathetic apology.,4.6
 Bed was uncomfortable room wasnt very clean. Extremely limited services. Got attitude from staff when I asked for water,4.6
Good location near the railway station comfy beds everything was clean friendly staff. The double window was also great no noise in the room.  A bit old but nicely maintained.,10
Double windows are very good for cancelling noise from the street. There were hair on the bed so we dont know if room was actually cleaned.,8
Great facilities (AC fridge coffe and tea). Central location  Can improve on cleaning particularly the entrance,8
Checking in was quite smooth. Nice breakfast. Friendly people in the town. Excellent food in Brasserie Francois at the edge of the square around the Cathedrale Saint-Aubain. We enjoyed a boat trip on the Meuse and Sambre rivers. The price was higher than expected - we had paid for only one breakfast and of course there were two of us plus the free on-street parking was about 700m away not 100m so we were expected to pay $15 to stay in a multi-storey car park near the station. We took the long walk instead! Disappointed that the Cathedrale Saint-Aubain was closed off by builders fences with no explanation. Its supposed to be one of the top attractions of Namur along with the citadel (which incidentally was difficult to find - follow signs for Terra Nova).,7
staff welcoming and helpful room comfortable and quiet kettle and tea coffee provided in room. Cant think of anything I didnt like.,9.6
Very kind and helpful receptionists a true asset. Very good sound insulation (not always the case even in high-end hotels in Belgium!). Room 308 had a good overview towards the beautiful building of the train station.  Breakfast somewhat overpriced. Hotel interior a bit outdated cleaning could be improved. ,8
Big room nice view of the citadelle elevator very clean great price air conditioning 10 min walk to really great neighborhoods.  Outside the hotel is a bit scary and dirty (due to local clientele). Not the hotels fault it just surprised us. ,8
Fantastic staff around 24/7 so helpful and friendly! Great convenient location close to everything but quiet and peaceful super clean and secure hotel great water pressure great functioning A/C and they welcomed our dog. Liked the convenient drinks available in lobby. Parking easy. Will stay here again! Immediate vicinity is a bit sketch across from train station but dont be put off or worried by that just walk around the corner to the pedestrian district.,10
I liked the luxurious aspect of the hotel coming from the entrance to the reception. And I equally enjoyed the modern feel of the room which is well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the air condition was so much appreciated on that warm day! The only thing that bothered me was that it felt very warm in the gangway between the lift and the room. The price for the breakfast (which I didnt take) seems fairly expensive (about 20$ if I remember correctly).,10
The breakfast was great and Loic at the reception is very welcoming & helpful ,9
Friendly staff Smelled of smoke. Room was very cold when I arrived. Breakfast basic (& no butter),7.1
Very nice location! Legendary hotel! Sad that the old interior is not kept..,7
Great location pleasant staff spotlessly clean and comfortable  ,10
The staff are very friendly and helpful. The beds are clean and very comfortable. It is an ideal place for an overnight stay. ,7
Good location. Clean bedroom Not nice decoration bad design. Too expensive for what offered,5
Service is good good location just near the train station the staff is kind polite and helpful. That is awesome for having a short stay in Namur.  The WiFi is poor! Most of the time you could not reach the internet through the WiFi.,9.6
Excellent location near train station but walking distance to historic center and other attractions. Helpful staff. Room quiet and warm though facing busy street due to two sets of double-pane glass at each window. Comfortable bed. ,9.2
Good breakfast facilities met my expectations. Good location. Public parking easy. Public parking was close by but its entrance was very dirty.,7
The staff is friendly and helpful. The room is clean comfortable and really quiet despite noisy surroundings. Good location near train station but walking distance to historic center and other attractions. Discounted parking is very close too.Breakfast was really nice with a good variation of food. The wifi connection was often not too good.  The room could have been bigger a little bit (too close to the toilet and shower in the bathroom).,8
The room was clean and beds are comfortable. The rooms are very quiet so dont worry that it is just across the street from the main train station. They have a reduce parking ticket of 60% off so.make sure to buy it in the lobby. This is not the good part of town since it is next to the train station and doesnt feel very safe at night.,9
We had a great time at this hotel. Location at 5 min from the center and right next to the train station. Clean rooms well soundproofed confortable large beds. Professional staff couldnt have been better. ,10
Very spacious bathroom and staff that satisfied my request to have bathtub the crowd in front of the hotel itself (near the station) is a bit intimidating,8
I enjoyed the train station view. The location was excellent.the room was cozy. The personnels was truly friendly.,10
The receptionist was helpful with all the questions we asked bed was comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet.  The lights in the room and in the toilette did not work since it was a Saturday nobody came to fix it just the receptionist came to take a look but of course he is not an electrician so he wasnt of much help. No room change was offered since they were full. One of the towels had a hole in it. ,6
 I have  been coming back to this hotel for the best part of 20 years..i think that  says it all. Namur is de flandre,9
Clean room  clean & spacious bathroom Location and entrance Parking was initially not really clear due to road works in town and not recognizable by GPS.  Strange and marginal people hanging around in the vicinity of the hotel which is located across the train station which may give you an unpleasant feeling of being not safe. Although theres a facility in providing a protective glass door which prevents splashing water while taking a shower standing upward in the bath : one ends up in a swimming pool when stepping out of the bath after being showered ( wet floor ) as water flows in between the glass door and the bath  => tried preventing this the next time by putting a towel in between that gap ..  but unfortunately in vain :(,6
Bed was comfortablegood bed linenvery helpful stafflovely and quiet despite being opposite to the railway station. ,8
Great reception service the building seems renovated. You have everything needed inside a room The room lacks some space to open the doors and the toilet is separated from the shower (bathroom is separated in 2 different spaces),8
Plenty of space nice furniture great position friendly and professional staff coffee and a boiler a safe and a fridge in your room smart price ,10
Hotel is right in front of the train station. The rooms were well isolated against noise and they were clean. There is no reception. The hallways were a bit dirty.,6.3
Very good sound proofing room not too hot comfortable beds clean bathroom. Great breakfast good choice of items and welcomed by a member of staff when we arrived at nearly 1 am. As an added bonus a great beer bar down the road. ,10
Its location was fantastic. The premises in general are old but rooms were renewed and very nice. Confy and clean. Everything was nice,9.6
Comfortable and classy hotel in an old building right across the road from the train station. Beds are comfortable aircon works well double window frames isolate the sound from the road.  The only weird thing is that the entrance door is wide open during the night and closed for the day.,8
 I could smell second hand smoke in our non-smoking room.,9.6
 Hotel needs an upgrade. Rooms are OK but corridors and social areas look old and dirty,6.3
Spacious room and bathroom great location.  ,8
Friendly staff modernly refurbished rooms silent even though situated next to the train station. The neighborhood around the train station is a bit rough but the hotel was lovely and walking distance to the centre and the citadel.,8
I HAVE BEEN VISITING THIS HOTEL FOR 15YEARS OR MORE....NEED I SAY ANYMORE A few more coffee bags please,10
Super friendly staff and excellent location :) . Even though is located in front of the train station it is very quiet. ,8
Location: nicely situated near the station and the city centre.  Double windows to isolate the noise of the street which is logical as it was so close to the railway station.  Very clean beds and room. Room had enough space and was in a modern style.  Staff was very helpful. Spoke good French/Flemish (Dutch) and decent English. ,8
This hotel is in a good location for exploring Namur.  While there is no parking on the premises parking is very close and discounted by the hotel.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The rooms are clean comfortable and well appointed. We were pleased with everything.,10
Huge comfortable bed. Friendly staff. The location was not good. Very hectic during the day very tricky to find a parking space. After about 7pm most of the bars and restaurants were closed and the area was full of people begging for cigarettes or money or food. Quite scary.,5.8
The whole experience was amazing from start to finish. I could not fault any part of my stay. Highly highly recommended.  ,10
Fantastic friendly staff. Close to the track only a 20 minute walk. Excellent food. A minor complaint in that the toilet doors would slam shut very loudly either by people leaving them or by being caught by the wind which meant it disturbed sleep at times enough to startle and make you jump. But this is the only real complaint I have from my entire weekend stay.,9.6
Very friendly and helpful staff. Superior cabin was well equipped for camping novices! Lots of food and beer on offer with choices to suit everyone. Would have preferred a choice of spirits and mixers to be on sale at the bar.,8.8
Extremely well looked after by the staff and better then just camping. Some campers were loud after hours and werent respectful of others. Which was tough for the staff to control.,8.3
It was the perfect location to watch the F1 racing. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. A suggestion for next year is to have at least a shuttle service to and from the bottom of the road especially with people having so much luggage and rainy weather. Better info boards as to the location of the site. ,9.2
Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere at the camp just adds to the amazing experience.  ,9.6
Proximity to track The tent collapsing because of all the rain,9.6
Amazing stay couldnt have had a better view. The fireplace the open bathroom the complementary champagne bottle the beds everything was more we were expecting. Great breakfast service we even could take something extra with us for the day. The local pizza place in Durbuy delivers to the camping but make sure to order well in advance. Make sure to switch on the heating when you arrive as the tent takes some time to heat up.,10
The scenery is amazing - public facilities looked neat clean and new. There were construction activities during our stay we did not know about. It made quit some noise.  Even though the (Shaka) tent looks very nice a couple of things were broken like the toilet handle bathroom light piece of (outside) chair was missing value for money was not to be found there. Also we received the keys for a second row tent while there were tents available on the first row prices were the same but still were given a tent with a much lesser view.   The second night of our stay there was a party going on and even though they were asked (at midnight) to turn down the music and be considerate of others this was ignored and sleeping was impossible until after 1.30AM.,6
The decor and place was amazing such a beautiful location very original concept and great for kids.The food was also very good the breakfast was very complete so many activities around and all family friendly We had an experimental tent because it was the only one left and I think the price was very high because it was last minute but I feel like it was too high for the available facilities and service.The showers were not clean or handy and the service was quite slow and bad.,8
Fun experience very clean facilities helpful and English speaking staff delicious breakfast. ,10
nice concept & ambiance  nice view  playground for kids  save no cars  possibility to have breakfast maybe add the possibillity to drink a coffee and eat a pancake in the afternoon?,8
The tent is big ans spacious. The bed are comfortable. Nobody takes care of the quiet hours and party people kept talking and drinking loudly until 4:30.,8
At was not aware that needed to take bed sheets and towels. It is great that I was provided with all needed but charged quite high. Overall price turned to be like a hotel room. ,8
Great concept and idea nice setting child and adult friendly great staff (all at least bilingual) !!! Beautiful swimming pool Expensive for what you get 1 coffee at breakfast from second you needed to pay extra padel at 42$ for 90 min check out at 10 artificial flowers dangling down noisy landscaping works from early morning no towels for rent no medical post ,7
Close to the adventure park walkable. Very clean bathrooms.  Not many BBQs,8.8
everything was good! friendly staff great location clean showers en toilet breakfast was really good WIFI was not possible in the glamping tent,7.9
Stay. location. staff. facilities were good. heating facility.,8.8
The view is beautiful on site. Its so easy to access Durbuy from the glamping location. Breakfast was delivered straight to our door the next morning. I wish the restaurant wouldve been open so that we could order food to our room. I know COVID has caused a lot of things to close but this would have been nice.,8
The Shaka tents are great! Specious everything available. The beds were comfortable. The water tap would run with warm water for just a few seconds and then turn to cold again. The shower on the other side was just fine. ,9
Breakfast Way too expensive 230$/night is a rip off for this level of comfort. Not even microwave or water boiler in room.,4
Clean tents and toilets Nice location. You can hear snoring and partying from other tents . For simple meal we waited 1 hour . Construction works during day in the camping.,7
Great experience. Good location. The parking lot is way too far. Takes ages before the shuttle bus arrives. We even walked back from adventure valley cos the bus wasnt coming. The tent could have been cleaner. Even though its camping for that price we expected spotless clean def in times of corona. Dust & spider webs. Bathroom was ok though. Little outdoor kitchen would be a nice extra. After all too expensive for what you get but the glamping experience was nice. ,7
 There was a lot of noice at night. This could have been easily avoided by surveillancing at night.,8
People are very friendly and guide you well.Its very comfortable inside the tent.The activities are very nice. There was no ventilation in the tent (in hot days its very annoying). There is no nearby shops to buy something necessary. Very dark outside.,8
Staff was nice the view and location were perfect.  Everything was perfect except for the heater. Too cold at night.,8
You feel like beeing in a little house but with all the positive feelings of sleeping in a tent. Amazing view over the ardennes. Special place to park the cars. Car free zones. ,8.8
The nature and everything was clean It was a little cold in the tent and night and when you turn on the fireplace it was too warm,10
Very friendly owner spacious and beautifully decorated room bathroom was very clean. Free coffee and tea very good WiFi.  Unfortunately parking was only free from 6pm to 9am. After that only 2h parking so if you want to spend the day in the city you need to find another parking space which is quite expensive in Brussels.,9.6
I needed to pay in the house directly and not thorugh Booking and they didnt accept card payments. Also we had scheduled the checkin at 15h and once there they told me to come back at 20h. This is not acceptable. The timing they give you and they make you adapt to their last-hour issues.,5.8
The apartment comprises of a very large room on the top floor of an apartment house with a bathroom shared with other tenants. It is in close proximity to a metro station as well as the Church of Our Lady of Laeken and the neighbourhood seems rather quiet (although there was some late-night roadworks happening on one of the nights I was staying there). Overall the apartment offer excellent value and I would not hesitate to recommend it for a short stay. The wifi is very patchy and prone to disconnects.,8.3
 In the hot weather a fan would have been a welcome addition,8.3
The only thing is the reception of a friendly young girl who helped with the search for some information. Room on the top floor there was no Wi-Fi the mattress is very soft the body collapses like a hammock. Noise outside the window and mosquitoes at night. Couldnt sleep.  The room has no refrigerator or at least a kettle.,5
Large comfortable rooms suited for double occupancy. Bed was very comfortable.Quiet and serene Nothing,7.9
 Its not a hotel. its like rooms in a big house and they all use the same toilet.. no heat in the rooms. its Decembercold and rainy and theres no heat .couldnt even dry out my clothes,5.4
The location was great and the room was huge clean and well iluminated. The wifi signal was too weak did not reach the uppet level room.,9.6
The room was clean and beds were comfortable As a frequent traveler it was by far the worst experience Ive ever had with booking.com. The room was cold in late December and although my booking included heater the owner refused to turn it on and told me I could change my reservation if I was cold! She also tried to stopped me to use the bathroom on my checkout saying that she had already cleaned it! Apart from the disrespectful behavior of the owner the shared toilet was so dirty. The WiFi was poor and not work at second floor. I had to walk many steps down (these steps were also another issue!) to get some poor signal. It is not value for money at all. I honestly believe such an awful property should never be listed in booking.com.,3
If you like invents then its not to bad Close to metro,6.3
I liked the landscape at night. Can oversee the atomium far away. The bath tab was super dirty. SO I CLEANED UP!!,4.2
Beautiful and very spatious room very friendly owners ,10
It was very clean The WiFi is very bad :(,7.5
The lady helped me with my suitcase all the way to the 2nd floor. There was no iron that I could borrow.I stayed there during the heatwave - having a fan in the room would have helped.,8.3
Friendly host clean and luxurious room with all comfort needed and right in the city centre of bridges next to the Belfort. ,9
Fantastic location on the Great Market. Great room with super view. ,7.9
Super authentic style in the city heart. Definitely needs opaque curtains,9
Great location.  Center of old town on the market square. We asked about a taxi the night before we left as we needed to be at the train station by 8:30. We asked for a taxi at 8:00 am.  The staff said they would arrange the taxi for us.  We went down in the morning at 8:00 and no taxi.  We asked the one staff person there but she could not call us a taxi.  We had no cell phone service to call ourselves.  We subsequently missed our train and has to cancel a touring stopped we planned to make.  We are very disappointed in the staff.,8.3
The house is very extraordinary. Same as photos shown. Convenient location. Awesome decoration. And the staffs are super friendly. They welcome us every time we come back:) Nothing!!!!,10
Great area. Right in the downtown city circle. Super friendly staff. The view was exceptional would definitely come back soon. ,9
Prime location on the square.  Lovely  big room . Great view too ,10
Huge room incredible view of the town centre  The room was hot but a bit of a heat wave was going on at the time.,10
Living like in a museum Great location Underground parking 200 m away Authentic furniture ,10
Our room was really clean big and cosy. We loved the view from our terrasse. ,10
Beautiful and comfortable room. The hotel room exceeded my expectation! I felt like a queen in this spacious room which had beautiful paintings and huge Belgian lace in a glass frame.  Great view of the Grote Markt and had a good view of the parade and festivities in the square.  I loved the Belgian Waffle served in the hotel for breakfast! None,10
Whats not to like about an old elite apartment overlooking the city square !! ,9.6
The location and design of home Staff!,5
Excellent location lovely staff amazing room super comfortable bedLocationRoom sizeComfortCleanliness Nothing really,9
UNBELIEVABLE location one of the best views I ever had. You are in a medieval house with painted glass windows and it is just BREATHTAKING. Friendly personnel nice details (bathrobe slippers etc.). AMAZING value for money. NOTHING. We LOVED it!,9
Location and space in the rooms was fantastic Very difficult to find as the guest house is above a restaurantby the same name but operated by different owners. The heating was not working and the rooms were too hot requiring multiple requests to adjust but to no avail. The staff in the restaurant were not very accommodating for the guests in the hotel.,7.5
Location bedroom style view on the main square. No breakfast included,8
Location was brilliant very clean staff where very helpful and a delightful room. Will stay there again  Nothing it was a great hotel great price and staff where excellent ,10
Stunning huge room over looking the market place. Best place Ive ever stayed.. ,10
Location was perfect and the view from our room was amazing. The room was huge and our little boy had his own bedroom which made it feel more like home from home.  ,9.6
This was our favorite part of the trip! Perfect location. Adorably quirky rooms. Comfortable beds. Friendly staff. Wed come back in a heartbeat! ,10
Amazing suite with amazing views. Absolutely huge room and so much better than expected of a guest house ,10
Nice location approachable staff. No wifi that time some of the lights are not working. ,8
We were totally bowled over by how wonderful our room was it was so special for our first romantic trip together!  The bed was so comfortable and luxurious a bathtub in the room bathrobes and slippers  fridge coffee machine.  Windows overlooking Market square it was just magical! Honestly- nothing!  The fact that it is over a restaurant felt interesting rather than odd unique in a great way.,10
Loved loved the location!!!   Loved the beautiful architecture and lovely windows in our room. Was super roomy and nice.  The restaurant at hotel is delicious as well. Need better pillows for sleeping..they were uncomfortable,10
The location could not have been better. with being situated on the main market square. The view from the roof terrace was amazing too and the decor throughout the place was classy and had a nice touch The check in process could have been smoother. A pointer on the site could have been helpful to ask for a certain member of staff etc as we were waiting outside the restaurant for a while after speaking to a waitress. But other than that place was amazing,9.6
Location size and charm of the rooms.  Bed wasnt the most comfortable no amenities. ,7.9
Loved the location! Just perfect. Lovely apartment within walking distance to everything. A little noise from the square into the early hours but all well worth it. ,9.2
Hotel was in a very quiet location. My room had no en-suite but had a private bathroom nearby. Breakfast was very good with excellent choice. The staff couldnt have done more to be helpful at breakfast. ,8.8
I have been back one day and I have already told everyone about this space. It was fabulous! The owners were very welcoming and the place was immaculate and very comfortable. A really elegant oasis in Brussels. ,10
The house is absolutely stunning. The room is very tastefully decorated and the bathroom is very spacious. The breakfast was really good. And the swimming pool is a true gem! Im not sure its very convenient in terms of location for those who come to explore Brussels without a car. But with a car thats absolutely fine.,9.6
A lovely building and friendly and helpful staff Our bedroom was a little chilly at night,9.2
The property was very clean the beds are extremely comfortable and the house very well equipped. It was also very well located just as we needed. I would return :) You really have to right down the right time for check in as they come to the property to check you in.,9.2
This place is unbelievable. A green oasis in the middle of Uccle. We loved it! Great breakfast. Really nice people and property.The swimming pool is great! Nothing,10
The 1 hours of privacy at the private pool Not feeling welcomed because of our difference (cultural racial gender) The lies in the advert about the privacy of the place Ther pictures of the house that we did not have acces to,1
 Room could do with more lights and power plugs - but not a big issue.,9.2
Breakfast was great and well prepared. The Caretaker was excellent and made us feel very welcome. The location was perfect and tranquil. The facilities were very good. ,8.3
Big clean bedroom For almost ¬£200 for one night it was odd to be told that they would try to be there when we wanted to check in. And the sole use bathroom was not en suite but across a public landing. We did not realise it was literally a bed and breakfast room in someones private homebut thought it would be a small hotel.,5.4
Everything was very good! wifi signal was poor.,10
Excellent breakfast and very friendly staff. Very comfortable and spacious room. ,9.2
Beautiful place to stay with a great breakfast! ,10
Everything was just perfect cosy comfortable bed cleanliness friendly staff. ,10
Second floor apartment was comfortable and clean. On site property owner was very helpful and courteous. Good access to roads and public transportation. ,8.3
Semi rural and convenient location Noisy with vehicles coming and going at all hours,9.6
Everything Must separate bedrooms and living,9.2
Easy to book easy to get there and clean. Owner very friendly and gave advise where to go & what to see. Due to general heat wave in Europe in July/August apartment was very warm but Air conditioning made our stay very comfortable ,9.2
apartment was ok Location was near a garage box company where some people were hanging around - didnt give us a comfortable feeling. bikes could be stored safely in one of the garage boxes though all very dusty and dirty. apartment itself was clean.,6
It apartment had everything we needed and the hosts were great. It exceeded expectations. ,8.8
The kitchen is full equipped the bed is really comfortable the shower is great  and Johan (the host) is really friendly and helps with everything. ,8.8
The duplex layout gave plenty of useful space with everything you need. The bathroom was spacious with a good shower. The bed was very comfortable. Everything was good.,10
A great standard crockery bathroom fixtures & fittings comfortable very big bed!  Lovely quiet courtyard outside which would be perfect for a morning breakfast or evening drink.  Collection of key very simple and handy too. The stairs are very steep and narrow footing so didnt feel I could carry my suitcase upstairs.  Having said that there is nothing that the owners can do to rectify this but its mindful that if you have a heavy or large suitcase leave it downstairs.,10
Superb location in historical Antwerp everything within walking distance. Charming houses built against the magnificent St Jacobs (St James) church. Youre basically sleeping next to Rubens. Its not cheap and the furniture is pretty basic. In a unique location like this youd expect a bit more maybe some historical information about Antwerp or at least St James not just the standard info on where to eat or drink.,8
I really enjoyed the breakfast it was good value for money and its a very nice touch that it is brought to your room. ,10
If you travel a lot and welcome something different the Bernardin may well end up in your favourites. It has its quirks (courtesy of the steep stairs and ultra-hip  read pared-down  design but the style is impeccable the rooms in the courtyard ideally peaceful for after a busy day (with very appealing outside seating when the weather permits) and excellent hospitality by Stephanie and Bernard. The location is great for central Antwerp but far from the commotion of the Meir. A pair of hooks for the towels please.,9.2
- Proximity to the downtown (specifically the Meir) - The fact that youre basically staying in church - The private entrance - The flexibility of the cleaning staff - The ease of getting a hold of someone on the phone when you call - The only thing was that via email it was a bit difficult to get a quick response back.  - Be careful if you have someone old or unable to move because the stairs are very narrow but that is only because its a historic place. (so not really a con they can control),9
I had a great stay at Bernardin. A gorgeous property in a quiet location yet close to the Historic centre. The owners were more than helpful and breakfast was delicious! I would definitely recommend. I didnt have a problem with them but the stairs are very steep! So for anyone that has mobility issues it would be very difficult and not recommended.,9.6
Nice calm and cleaver designed hotelroom in the middle of Atntwerpen Little dangerous staircase,9.6
the rooms (I would also say the houses) are pretty lovely cosy well designed. The accommodation is very very authentic and original. It is well located in the center but it is also quiet. I would love it more if it was a little cleaner. And I would also change the cosmetics to be upper level Cathedral was under huge constructions (May 2021) but it is not disadvantage of the guesthouse,9
Lovely hotel in a cluster of small houses grouped around a church in Antwerp city centre. Very helpful and friendly host. Beautiful breakfast. Every room is in fact a tiny house with a first floor and a bedroom sitting room etc. All decorated with taste. ,9.6
Its a charming guesthouse small but very nice and comfortable. Everything is very functional including the collapsible shower walls. The bed was very comfy and the breakfast very nice - and delivered to our door! Would certainly recommend staying here.  The floor was a bit dirty. The stairs are very steep which was OK for us but maybe not for other people. ,7.9
Nicely located. Loved the mix of the old church wall the old floor with the modern shower and furniture. Staff was professional and friendly. Will come again really enjoyed my stay!  Some dust under the chair and bed in my room.,8.8
Its a lovely one bedroom house all to yourself. Comfortable bed coffee machine good shower quiet location but super centrally located. The old church walls are the interior walls for much of the property providing quirky architecture and loads of charm. Would stay again. I would have preferred a sofa in the living room rather than two seats. This is nitpicking though its a great guesthouse.,9
 Everything was really tiny and looked way bigger on the photos. The stair are really steep therefore its impossible to get the luggage to the bedroom but there wouldnt be space anywhere.. We wanted to sleep a little bit longer but they clean the appartment only till 11am. ,5.8
Great Location! Unique setting Tiny house against the church walls. Flexible staff.  Nothing really,9.2
 The lack of the a door between the toilet and the bedroom,7.5
First of all the lady at the checkin is a charm. Made us feel welcomed and refreshed. Secondly the location of the property is very apt. Right next to it is the Sint-Jacobs tram station as well as the Meir shopping district. Lastly the property is very nicely maintained. It is built inside a 17th or 18th century church but the interiors are very well done with a mix of ancient stone and modern gloss finish. Very comfortable and made me feel close to European culture. Not that it mattered much but in a duplex arrangement perhaps you could put wet points on both floors. Had to run to the bathroom upstairs each time we wanted to fill the cup of water.,9.6
We were greeted by the super friendly and helpful Stephanie. The room was warm and comfortable. The property is in a great location. No running water near the kitchen,9.2
The guesthouse is very relaxing and charming. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable. If you are nervous of heights the stairs are quite steep and slippery in socks to the bedroom - I would recommend for the owners to put down some sort of gripped material on the steps. Also you have to be careful to not get water all over the bathroom with the shower head. Communication with staff for arrival time could be better.,7.1
 The stair up to the bedroom is pretty steep.,8.3
I liked the location it is very quiet and still right in the center of Antwerp. The hosts were very friendly. I would use this place again. Thank you. ,9.6
Could not be better situated! Few minutes walk to the central station. Bars and restaurants close by but NO noise at all. ,9.6
Great location lovely comfortable spacious room with beautiful silence and deep darkness at night. The most restful nights sleep you can hope for. The host is amazing so accomodating and friendly. Could have added a complimentary waffle! But seriously no complaints genuinely excellent experience.,9.6
Great location great ambiance lots of bars and restaurants nearby As a family with 2 small children the property was hard to access with a double stroller due to lots of stairs. Otherwise its great.,9.2
Comfortable quiet room in central location in Brussels.  Edmund was a friendly engaging host who offered tips and suggestions for restaurants transportation etc. in and outside of the city  he also kept our luggage after check-out and allowed us to pick it up later in the afternoon. ,10
Nice and comfortable. Fantastic location. Very friendly and nice host Edmund. Shower pressure very weak. The cold water in bathroom sink had very low pressure.,9.2
Host was superb and friendly and so was his cat! The room was modern spacious very clean and cosy. Was pretty much right in the centre everywhere was walking distance. Nothing!,10
Quality studio and really quite environment. The location is awesome everything near by foot. Nice balcony and coffee machine! There was an expired moldy bread left in the closet though lol,9.2
Nice location staff very friendly Facility not well maintained. Room is too dark inside even with all the lights on.,7.9
The host was excellent. Location facilities and convenience superb Towells,9
The Room is very comfortable it has everything you need calmness coziness cleanliness and very neat. The host was amazingly helpful .Highly recommended The room temperature is acceptable but not very warm,8.8
I liked it very much . I felt good in a good place and a surrounding that works. I asked via booking.com e directly if I could stay one night more and that my arrival would be later. It takes nearly a day to have answer and the welcome was Perfect but then i was told that for the second night we have only to change the room and then that there wasnt a room anymore . So we only slept there little hours and then we left without enjoying the confort .,8
We had a great stay here.  It was clean and comfortable.  The host was very responsive and easily reached.  He was very kind to meet us 2 hours later than he expected because I had given him the wrong arrival time.  The location is fabulous and we would definitely stay again.  He provided us with lots of information regarding restaurants and things to do. ,10
Perfect location and very comfortable room. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for a quiet spot near the heart of Brussels. ,9.6
It is in the middle of everything you would like to visit in Brussels so comfort the terrace is amazing. Evrything was perfect,10
If you are bored with the standard this is for you. ,9.6
Beautifully decorated room excellent location with no noise from street regardless of extremely central location. Comfy bed and good pressure in shower. Coffee/tea facilities available on common areas. Edmund is a fabulous host and available for any needs that might arise. My room entrance was right next to entrance to the property. On last night there was quite some traffic on the outer door which was a bit disruptive. Admittedly im a light sleeper so most would likely not care. On same note it would be nice to have a safety chain/latch on the door to have it surely locked when in room.,10
Very well located very welcoming and really cute room and place to stay. I would strongly recommend it !  ,10
The interior was modern with very nice furniture. The room was well lit with several lamps and convenient switches and outlets. The location was exceptional in a local part of town that is close to bars and walkable to many of Brusselss good restaurants. The hosts were friendly and personable. The breakfast items were always available for snacks and the tea selections were amazing. I actually went and bought the exact same two tea blends because I loved them so much! It felt like I was staying at a 5-star hotel. The water pressure was too low.,10
The loft is decorated in an industrial style the fisrt impression is breathtaking. A very nice place to stay. The bathroom is well equiped. The flat is in the center close to the city life but completely noiseless. Honestly I dont see.,9
We had a very nice stay in the apartment. Is was clean in the middle of the city and the host was very kind.  ,10
Perfect location and lovely room. Cereal and croissants for breakfast was a nice touch. ,9
Host very helpful with local knowledge. Room was very comfortable. Location was good. No tea or coffee making facilities.,10
Breakfast was very good eggs anyway you want them cereal meats fruit yoghurts croissants etc. More than enough and all was fresh. We had 2 rooms on the top floor 65 stairs but we knew that and was very good exercise as they do not have a lift we knew that also. Great rooms and large bathrooms with all mod cons. Could not have been better. The owner was very helpful what a nice man. Central to the main town squares easy to find and parking for me with a Blue Badge was great. Loved our weekend. BRIAN I didnt like that we only had 3 nights. I didnt like that we had to leave.,9.6
Everything! Very charming guesthouse in a great location walking distance to all the main areas. Staff were very polite and helpful. Breakfast was great. Rooms were very spacious with big bathrooms. Highly recommend. Nothing,10
Very spacious rooms and ensuite. Lovely breakfast staff welcoming and attentive. Building beautiful and in great location. Not a big problem but if mobility is difficult stairs to rooms my be troublesome. No lift due to age and style of building.,10
The location is excellent only 5 minutes walk to the main square and Christmas market. The facilities are excellent and very comfortable.. The property owner is very friendly and always on hand if you need anything. On arrival he showed us key points on the map and recommended walks to take. Having stayed at the Guesthouse Mirabel I wouldnt stay anywhere else in Bruges.  ,10
Great location. Room spacious and clean. Good breakfast ,10
Everything could not fault this B&B.  Every detail was covered.. felt very welcome from the first time coming through the door to leaving.  Great location.. less than 5 mins walk to the central squares and main attractions.  Rooms very large and extremely clean.. very good rates of pay..will not be using anyone else next visit to Bruges..Well done Gaston and team..see you again soon.. Nothing.. It was all perfect..Gaston was such a good host..,10
Location facilities host breakfast Steps but not allowed a lift :P,10
A wonderful stay in beautiful Brugges! The place is fantastic like an italian palazzo furnishing is perfect the room was spacious and grand very clean and decorated with exclusive taste - Gaston ia a great host polite and generous - breakfast was wonderful - overall I wouldnt change anything! Nothing everything was perfect!,10
Very friendly owner great location and very clean would definitely return and recommend. ,9.6
Wonderful guesthouse set in a prime location for visiting Bruges. Spacious bedroom and bathroom with great views of the city.Very Friendly and helpful hosts. Amazing breakfasts too. Couldnt fault it. Nothing!,10
Brilliant service exellent staff very clean and so close to the centerof the city. Very helpful staff. ,9
Great selection at breakfast time. Staff extremely friendly and helpful.Really cant fault the place. ,10
The owner and his wife were charming and so helpful. The room was stunning! It could not be bettered in any way!,10
Excellent location.  Rooms lovely clean and spacious. Excellent breakfast with a wide choice.  Superb host very friendly and accommodating with lots of advice about the area..will be back. Cherry on the cake would be tea and coffee facilities in the room.,10
Superb location wonderful host and comfy rooms. Everything was superb.,10
The location of this guesthouse is perfect for visiting all areas of bruges it was also within walking distance of the train station. The host Gaston was really helpful Coffee making facilities would have been a help,9
Breakfast was super the choice of eggs was a nice option WiFi was a little patchy but didnt spoil our stay,10
The breakfast was amazing and Gaston even cooked us eggs to order.   The chocolate croissants were fresh and heavenly.   We were able to store our bikes near the entrance of the hotel so going around the town was extremely easy and convenient.  Great location to see Bruges! There was nothing I can think of that I would say was a bad experience at all!,10
We were made very welcome by the hoteliers right from the moment the door was opened to the moment we left a lovely guest house all round. There was nothing we didnt really like was a 74 stair hike to our room but we do understand that this is a grade listed building of history so will be expected.,10
Big rooms. Clean. Friendly service. Decent breakfast Two flights of stairs with no lift we didnt expect this. Glad I had two big boys to help carry our bags. :),9.2
 Pity the house smells slightly of cold tobacco but that wouldnt stop us from returning.,10
Very kind Very cleanVery comfortable Spacious roomGreat locationNice breakfast ,9.6
Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom! Friendly and helpful owner and lovely charming period feature property in a central location but still quiet. The heating was perhaps a little slow to come on and heat the room perhaps due to high ceilings. We travelled in December.,8.8
Close to everything large and comfortable room and bathroom clean they change towels every day very kind host.  ,10
The room was huge. Bathroom lovely. Breakfast fresh. Location very good. Gaston very helpful and friendly. ,10
It has been a fantastic stay. The whole house has been freshly renovated my room was spacious with a shower and a bath a coffee machine a wooden floor and beautiful decorations. The host pays attention to the smallest details she is extremely friendly i felt very welcome. The breakfast was incredible -again everything prepared in the smallest details. I will come back without hesitation. ,10
The location and helpfulness of the owner and the facilities made the stay most enjoyable. Only one small comment....you need to be able to climb stairs but this is mentioned on the website. nothing!,10
Absolutely lovely stay. Friendly and helpful welcome from the host. Very comfortable and clean room. Great breakfast both in terms of quantity and quality. It is clear that the host puts a lot of efforts to ensure a great customer experience. Just perfect end to end! ,10
Great Location friendly staff and a lovely spacious room. ,10
it was just as advertised beautiful locationwould recommend this guesthouse. Zero,10
Great location! A spacious room everything recently renovated. Agna is an amazing host very dedicated and a perfectionist. The breakfast was delicious and quite generous. ,9
After arriving hours later than we had predicted we were given a warm welcome in this stunning building located so centrally! The breakfast was extensive they collect the pastries from a local bakery at 7am each morning! Exceeded my expectations! Whilst it didnt worry us aswe enjoyed the view there is no lift so those with younger children might want to check to see if there are rooms available on a lower floor.,10
 It doesnt have an elevator a bit hard on a 70+ lady.,10
Large spacious room. Lovely bathroom. Safe in room. Traditional older building with very nice decor. Nice breakfast. Missed having a kettle in the room as I like to have tea or coffee first thing in the morning and at night.,9
Great location and wonderful host who made us feel very at home from the second we arrived As I was travelling with my elderly Mother the stairs were tricky but unavoidable,9.2
Clean and comfortable. Ample fresh breakfast located only a few minutes walk from the town centre. Street parking outside the B&B was easy to get. I had to walk the street to loocate the property as it did not have the name on it!,9.2
Clean high ceiling big room friendly host None,9.6
Wonderful weekend. A beautiful property maintained by a great guy. Gaston made us very welcome and evened offered to arrange dinner reservations if we hadnt made them. Spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated.  ,10
Agna is extremely friendly and takes care of her guests. She does not hesitate to give all the necessary information. The breakfast was excellent. The fruits are fresh as well as the bread and pastries and the quantities are generous! ,10
First of all I want to mention that Gaston is the best host weve ever seen. When we entered the apartment it was warm because they waited for us. Thank you so much it was so nice!Th guesthouse is cosy well furnished and has all the necessary stuff. The spacious bathroom with shower and bath was always clean. Breakfast was delicious especially scrambled eggs which were prepared for every guest individually. The location is great you are in the very center of the city. I really suggest that you visit this fabulous place!  Nothing to mention!,10
Owner & Staff excellent . Very warm welcome & gave us a map with things to see & do . All in all very good experience first time in Brugge . ,9.2
Good service. Toilet is the best with bidet shower.  Not much parking space near the house.,10
Great coffee machine room was lobely It was a perfect base lovely shower and room perfect,10
The hotel was nice and quiet the host was very helpful with giving us information on the area like best areas to eat. Would stay there again.  ,10
- Great location (20mins walk to main square)- modern room- very clean- great host who explained us where we can park for free The only thing I did not like was the annoying ticking noise the radiator made all the way throughout the night disrupting our sleep. ,9.2
Very cleanCoffee and tea facilities  Leaving our shoes at the door  Our room had onsuite shower toilet but no privacyNo available parking even in public parking,7.5
Friendly host good restaurant recommendation pleasant stay Not much,9.2
Nice amenities very good shower. Room is clean. Very comfortable bed slept like a baby. Hosts are wonderful  A lot of mosquitos (( dont forget to slide the mosquito net down,10
They were kind enough to securely lock our cycles in there garage the room was spacious comfortable and clean. Would happily stay there again. Nothing bad to say,9.6
Everything was great: the neighborhood the house the owner very nice and helpful. We will definitely come back. -,10
The room and facilities were well decorated clean spacious and comfortable. The prices were very reasonable. The owner is wonderful and helped us call an early-morning cab print tickets learn about Brugess main tourist locations etc. Plus the location is good. The main sights are all less than a 20-minute walk away. ,9.6
Clean spacious good location with free parking and free shuttle bus to the city . Owner was great - accommodating on the check in time knowledgeable and willing to explain the attractions around to us NIL,10
Great location close enough to the centre but far enough to be perfectly relaxed and quiet.Check out wasnt too early so no hassle in the morningEverything was clean easy in and out The bed was a bit hard for me but thats personal ,9
Very nice house and area kind owners. Coffee tea and water in the room. Clean and comfortable. ,9.6
Great location. Only a 15minute walk to the main square. Good size room and a comfy bed. ,9.6
Lovely place to stay room was fantastic! Nothing,9.6
I like the mattress and towels very much. ,10
 In our room we had a private wash room clean and comfortable  only there isnt a seperating door from the room so it might get awkward. ,8.8
Spotlessly clean. Very modern and beautifully decorated. Friendly and helpful host. Parking is a little inconvenient if traveling by car because the safe free parking is a 12 minute walk. Alternatively one has to use metered parking. We enjoy walking so it wasnt an issue for us but it could be for some - weather depending. ,9.6
Lovely accommodation excellent host and conveniently located within 15 minute walk of the main market square. Highly recommended. Nothing,10
Lovely room with a great bathroom. The host was fantastic and made us feel very at home by giving us maps and all the best things to see in Brugge. Location was great only a short walk along the canal to the town. ,8
The guesthouse is located off a quiet little street just outside the main town area on Bruges. The lady who welcomed us we very nice and helpful she showed us were to park for free on the best way to walk into the city and where the bus stop was. The room was much bigger than I was excepting it with its own fridge and beautiful private bathroom. Would definitely stay again!  ,9.6
Good quality fixtures and fittings Its all good,9
Property lovely but manager unnecessarily unaccommodating. Asked what time the bar closed as we planned to get back for anniversary drinks after our meal. Was told 10 got there at about 9.30 and they wouldnt serve us just glass of Baileys  each as they wanted to close early. Despite us politely explaining that wed come back early to meet the timings they told us that there were 4 people in the bar with full drinks that it was a special occasion and we didnt plan to be long he said no and just shrugged.Really disappointing as the hotel room was very nice and the small bar looked lovely - if only we could have enjoyed it. ,7.5
Amazing room good facilities perfect location ,10
Absolutely outstanding loved having it bought to the room. Such a lovely touch. Plenty of choice and boiled eggs perfectly cooked. Set us up for the day. Nothing it was all perfect.,10
Location and it was very clean food is also amazing. Check in was amazing but staff after that where OK when we left the maid jumped in the room and we left over 2 hours before check out and upon check out we where not asked how our stay was.Alos cot was not put up we had to chase it up. The coffee/tea cups are so so small. ,7.5
Our room (Marilyn Munroe Room) was at the front of the property over looking the tZand and had lovely high ceilings and large windows lovey and airy and beautifully decorated.  Property was very close to the tZand underground parking in Bruges and central for all of the old city. Continental breakfast was served in the comfort of our room which was great. Staff very warm and welcoming. ,8
A room on the second floor with a view on tiled roofs the tower of the Basilica. The staff is always ready to help and answer questions. Seating area in the room is very cozy (comfortable armchairs tea corner) and gives you great chance to discuss your day drinking a cup of tea. The breakfast distinctive served in the room was very atmospheric and tasty. It is a GREAT ADVANTAGE of the hotel (still I have great desire to repeat it). No reception unusual entrance through the restaurant or back door steep stairs. These small inconveniences are acceptable but you should know about them in advance.,10
Good breakfast with local food. Small swimming pool was nice as the day was hot. Lovely location at the countryside. ,9
VERY big comfortable bed very quiet location ,10
Superb location in the midst of Belgian nature. The breakfast was delicious with local products. The owner took time to talk to us and gave us good recommendations for biking in the area. ,9.2
Quiet and green environment. The rooms are cosy and clean. Very friendly and helpfull host.  Excellent breakfast with organic food. Bread and jam were home made. ,10
Very nice place inside the nature.Bio Breakfast very big room and comfortable.. ,9.2
Charming place amazingly welcoming hosts. The breakfast was superb and the views were outstanding. Everything was excellent!,10
Lovely B&B in the  beautiful country side of Belgium. Spacious nice decorated room and bathroom with bath. Friendly host and simple but good breakfast with local organic products. Unfortunately we only stayed one night would love to come back to cycle and  enjoy the landscape. Liked everything but a extra pillow would be nice :-),9
Location The bed was small and the room was pretty hot,7
The Het Rustpunt is excelent. The bedroom was simple but very confortable. The breakfast was good. The hotel is located very close to the city center. We really feel relaxed and peaceful there. ,10
Kindness of the staff very good and abundant breakfast quiet though central location nice garden and parking facility. Nothing,10
The location is great really in the center and close to most of the historic points. During Covid we cant go to restaurant we had to order online we didnt receive any ustensiles to eat neither from the restaurant neither from the hotel. Also no kettle no fridge in the room.. During Covid these would have been handy.,7
Super facilities. Best was the reception with Bea and the corona breakfast(plenty) arrangement. ,8
Location is brilliant as was the welcome Write up and marketing visuals did not emphasise monasticism of the place.  No problem but would have influenced my choice on this occasion.  Could not get WiFi to work.  Mosquitos were a pest and room provisions against them had run out.,5
It was very well located to get to the centre of town It was very difficult to find the parking,8
Taking into account the covid-19 situation the owner made a special breakfast for us.They still try to have a personal contact with the visitors but in a very safe way. The facilities are great. The weather.,9
brilliant place owner was friendly breakfast was really good nothing,9.2
Very quiet hotel I liked all!! Very friendly and nice warm welcoming atmosphere. ,10
Was pleasantly surprised to find breakfast was included on weekdays. Lovely building spotlessly clean warm and friendly reception. Thoroughly recommended. ,9.6
The building was a comfortable modern update of a classic building. The service was excellent. ,9.6
This bnb is so good I came back for a second time! Totally worth the 1.5 hour drive. The place is clean exactly as depicted in the pictures and has value for money. The facilities are great and last but not least the owners hospitality is just immaculate. I had a problem with the smart tv and they solved it for me without hesitation. I would definitely come back for a third time.  ,10
The owners are very welcoming and friendly. The place is lovely and set in the middle of beautiful farmland. ,9.6
Amazing breakfast super friendly host lovely family perfect room. ,10
Very cozy bed&breakfast! Everything was fine. Thank you! ,10
Its an amazing place with a very high standard in a pretty location. I think its actually really underpriced for what it offers! The hostess is super nice and the breakfast could not have been better. The toilet is only behind a curtain not a door a little awkward when two in the room. ,10
Anja is very friendly! Everything was good.,10
Clean nice decor nice quite location Nearest restaurants 2 mile away,7.5
The accommodation is a group of lovely old buildings approximately 6km outside Geraardsbergen. The whole place is beautiful with guests being able to use the large lounge and kitchen areas. Theres plenty of outdoor space with a large landscaped garden. It was perfect as a base for cycling. I was met by the owner who showed me around including a secure place to store my bike. The room was modern and well equipped. The owner was very helpful and even let me use the room to shower in after I had checked out which was fantastic. I wish I could have stayed longer and will definitely go back again. Nothing really. My only niggle was the fact that because it was summer and I had my windows open I could hear a fountain in the Courtyard all night from my room.,9.2
 The room was very cold. And the water wasnt hot to take a shower.  I was force to go out like that without having my bath,3.8
This place is utterly stunning. Perfectly clean warm and comfortable with the most amazing views. The best location and has a small market cafe and all the main attractions right on the door step. The check in was a little fussy on arrival but sure it was just a one-off. Parking was a little tricky but I did have a van so didnt expect it to be easy. REEP car park was 10 minutes walk and cost 36 euros over the two days. Bargain in my opinion.,10
This place is exactly as seen in the photos.  There is a big wow factor when entering!  The location is fabulous!!  Its an easy short walk to everywhere you want to be there are lively pubs on the street a fruit market and public square are right out the door. We liked almost everything! The toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom.  This was very helpful for our group of 4. We would absolutely return. Be aware that it is on the top floor so step climbing is mandatory. The upper balcony is a fantastic place!!! The beds were rather hard and not very comfortable.  Our two teens opted to sleep on the couch which is HUGE.  My kids are very tall and fit fine,9.2
Location can not be better! Great comfort! Superbly clean flat! Not a dislike but staff is not always around I think. Ive waited some time for anybody to open the door. Again at check out Ive looked for somebody to drop the keys off. It took some time.,8.3
Loved this apartment perfect central location. Excellently stocked kitchen and lovely welcome (thanks for the bottle of wine!). Highly recommend and would happily stay again. ,10
Great location down the street from Friday Market -- walked everywhere.  Apartment as seen in photos clean great atmosphere loved the exposed brick walls gas fireplace nice decor terrace views of church towers from bedroom windows. Book this apartment if available. ,10
Fantastic location and beautiful apartment. Stairwell smelled really bad. Kitchen was okay but could have been better equipped for those who wanted to cook much.,9.2
This property is BEAUTIFUL! Clean classy. A kitchen to prepare meals if you dont want to eat out every night. The living/dining area is very nice plus there is a rooftop deck patio for dining. The location was on a square surrounded by dozens of fine eating drinking and dining and is easy walking distance to everything. Fully recommend! The location was excellent except - on Friday night the nearby nightclub music was blaring well into the early morning making sleep very much impossible. I dont know how this can be remedied but short of noise ordinance after 0200.  Most of my stay was during the weekday and except for Friday it was quiet and perfect!!!,9.6
Great flats in the centre of town superbly styled and comfortable.   Nothing,10
Apartment is spacious lovely and perfectly located. There is a well equipped kitchen which our host equipped with coffee tea and a bottle of wine. Balcony with table great in warm weather. Highly recommended. There is a small elevator helpful for luggage but large suitcases dont fit so these need to be carried up steep stairs.,10
Everything was on point! It was a perfect weekend. ,10
A beautifully appointed spacious and comfortable appartment in the city centre. We thoroughly enjoyed or weekend in Ghent. ,10
Beautiful spacious apartment  near center of old city Nothing.,10
Clean spacious and very well equipped.  For someone who stays for longer periods for work like myself access to a washing machine would be nice. But everything else made up for this. ,10
We loved our stay in Hof Van Spanje. The rooms were stylishly decorated spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and well set out and we liked having different seating areas at the dining table and in the sofa area. We could not have asked for more. The apartment was almost perfect the only small issue being the sensor operated hall light. This seemed very sensitive and we worked out in the end that it was triggered by people walking across the floor of the apartment above. We assume that it is mandatory to have a sensor operated light in Ghent but if this could be adjusted that would be an improvement. But this was a small detail.,10
The apartment has a beautiful roof terrace overlooking Gent. Location is perfect with all major sites within ca. 15min walking distance.The apartment is beaitiful well equipped with a lot of space. The landlord was super nice. Xheckin/out was easy as there is a restaurant in the same building which helps to manage.   ,10
Very beautiful. Nice terrace/balcony. Love the space. Full kitchen facilities.  Convenient location. Wow factor. Parking is near the unit Heater didnt work at first. Was fixed in a jiffy though.,8.3
All of it. Great location in the center of the city. Very good apartment  big rooms high ceilings clean well decorated  comfortable beds. We had such a great time there. We liked everything,10
Great location for exploring Ghent. Spacious for 4 guests. Outdoor terrace to enjoy the sunny weather.  Bedrooms were quite hot - maybe a couple of fans to cool them down would be a good idea.,10
Very easy key exchange with the owner. Nothing of note.,10
We loved everything there!!! It is beautiful and clean and confortable! The location could not be better and the host Paul is very nice!!! He welcome us with a nice bottle of wine! We will definitely be back in the future and would recommend anyone to stay there! Nothing! We loved everything!,10
The location was great apart from noisy concerts in the nearby square Thje hand basins were too small and we would have preferred a proper shower not one over the bath,9.6
The property was very close to the Market Place and all attractions.  Free parking is a plus in Brugge as it can be costly. Summer so mosquitos need to use the window nets.,10
Central location parking TV channels Bedside lighting poor.  One curtain missing in lounge.  No dishwasher tablets.,9.6
Great location garage facilities for our motorbikes Sofa bed very uncomfortable! Sorry but this was the only negative,9.6
The location was brilliant and being able to park in the attached garage was great. Nadia the hostess could not have been nicer. Probably some very bad luck but unfortunately we both experienced a problem sleeping due to being bitten by bugs multiple times and mosquitoes.,7.5
Absolutely fantastic location.  Nadia was brilliant and her recommendations were spot on. Towels were a bit rubbish very small.,8.8
Nadia met us and spent time going through practical details about the house but also loads of excellent tips for restaurants and local sights. ,9.6
Fantastic location.  The house was very homely and had everything that we needed.  Nadia was there to meet and greet us too. There was absolutely nothing that we didnt like,10
Very nice house in the historical center of Bruges. Perfect location beautiful area. Large and comfort rooms. All you need you have at the kitchen at the room and in the bathroom. Big windows comfort bed.  We stayed there for four days and liked it very much. Nice hostess everything was easy and very good. ,9.2
Having the parking was a huge plus  having the entire house was good.Very well equipped kitchen although we did not do much cooking as too many nice eating places close by .Nadia was brilliant met us on arrival and departure  unlike other places where we have stayed and was very helpful Looking forward to returning .  Nothing really,10
The location is excellent all amenities are functional the house is big also provate garage if tou are travelling by car. ,9.2
Excellent location-very close to all attractions. Washbasins in both bedrooms two toilets. Well-equipped kitchen. Owner very helpful and friendly. Good wi-fi. Bedding and towels were a little well-worn. Newer bedding and larger newer towels would have lifted the property. Waste bins in the bedrooms would have been good.,9.2
Excellent location very spacious well equipped very welcoming host.  Excellent all round but to be aware both bedrooms are twins - no double bed.,9.6
Great location. Very clean. Well-equipped kitchen. The host was responsive and nice. ,9.6
Location and having the whole house which was very clean Nothing,9.2
The location was good for us. Not in the centre so we had no noise when time to go to sleep. The renovation of the old home was well done. The steep and narrow staircases.,8.3
Close to everything very homely had everything we needed.  No mugs Im English I like tea in a mug!,9.6
loads of gadgets  hifi records books  etc  clean easy access for keys and parking outside ,10
Great location Car parking was a problem -,8.3
Great location. It was a stones throw from the Menin Gate. Very well equipped with the benefit of convenient car parking. The property also contained lots of useful information about the local area. Property is split over three levels with steep stairs in between. This was not ideal for our two year old.,9.6
Clean well equipped great location and very helpful service throughout booking and stay Nothing,10
Clean comfortable and excellent location Nothing,10
Sofa bed very comfy like a normal bed (we fell asleep infront of tv instead of going up to bed) information pack left for us very usefull Door a little hard to shut without key,10
As we were exploring the WW1 battlefields this was the perfect place to stay. The Menin Gate was only a couple of minutes walk away and the rebuilt Cloth Hall and Cathedral are also very close. This apartment is on 3 floors and the stairs are narrow and steep. Also the bedroom is at the top whilst the bathroom is on the ground floor.,7.9
cozy house perfectly located for a visit of the town ,7.5
The accommodation was very much in keeping with the character of Ypres and positioned within walking distance of the market square and Menin Gate. The stairs to the bedrooms were steep and narrow meaning we had to leave our suitcases downstairs but this was not a big issue for a short stay.,8.3
Great location would definitely return very helpful host Just the coffe,10
Great location great hosts good kitchen and supplied electronic items Stairs very steep so would not recommend for elderly guests and young children  apart form that  I would highly recommend this property,10
great location great appartement. Comfortable beds everything great also the welcome basket incl the beer. ,10
Excellent Location Only negative two flights of stairs to go to toilet.  Steep stair may be a struggle for some people not sure if these are mentioned in the advert but should be indicated as this will affect some people,7.9
The location was incredible. The home was lovely. There was a thorough welcome pack with all sorts of tips and recommendations about the town. Also coupons for activities. Also the towels were big and fluffy! I also enjoyed the little enclosed courtyard. (Very tiny but nice in the summer) The double bed was up two steep narrow flights of stairs and the sloped ceiling prevented standing up in the room. It was impossible to get luggage all the way up there.  The single bed was actually a daybed doubling as a couch in the sitting room up one floor. You have to go through that room to get to the attic bedroom. But for the location it is worth it.,9.2
The house is in a fantastic location within 5 minutes walk to the centre of Ypres. It has every little extra you can think of including beer in the fridge which was so appreciated after a long drive. Everybody was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Although we loved the quirky stairs for two flights of stairs which werent s problem for us elderly or infirm people may struggle here. All in all a fabulous little house and we would definitely stay here again if we visited Ypres again. Thank you Bernard and Maria.   ,10
Very easy. I was given the code to access the keys and had no problems Very steep narrow steps to two floors. Dangerous for young children,9.2
The location is perfect! 5 min walking to the Mein Gate nice restaurants around. The house is cozy LOT of stairs but very nice and comfortable. Check in a little bit earlier would be nice,9.6
Fabulous location 5 minute walk to the town centre amenities and historical sites.. Property was pretty much perfect well organised fabulously clean and very comfortable for our family of 4 No negatives at all,10
It was clean and very central and the welcome treats were a lovely touch.  The cottage was perfectly functional and nicely decorated. There werent enough sheets for the bed settee so had to use blankets out of the cupboard.,10
There was airconditioning in the room  And everything else was great! Will book again in the future! The timing for the breakfast. if you where 30min late Is was a big issue for the staff..,8
The hotel is in the centre of Hasselt walking distance to the nice area of restaurants and bars Hasselt has a great atmosphere. The hotel is good and a nice place to stay for the night. The parking costs $ 19 but if you drive to the streets in the area you should be able to find a spot at least in my case it was quite easy. Just bear in mind that you need to either leave before 9 or pay in the machine the charge for the next morning until the time you stay otherwise you could be fined.,9.6
Friendly staff nice hotel good breakfast  ,8
Breakfast was very good! The location of the hotel is near the parking which is comfortable. Easy to get to the center of the city. The room was clean and looked great. Staff is terrific. Cant remember any problem there.,10
Staff super friendly and helpful. Modern feel in the lobby & eating area. bed was quite comfortable but found the room pretty basic. There was small sitting area and tv with limited channels. Continental breakfast was included and contrary to other hotels you could still had good selection later in the day! getting to the parking was really a hassle. Although it was just steps away from the hotel we had to take the small ring and do a full 360 to get to in. There are 2 entrances and the one in front of the Holiday Inn is super tight fit. We had to inch our way in. And be careful there are 2 holiday inns in the same area : holiday inn and holiday inn express.,7
 Sofa bed was not made up on arrival (although the lovely receptionist solved this quickly for us) and that bed was very uncomfortable. Kept banging legs on the metal outer structure which was above the height of the thin mattress. Not what I would expect for ¬£130/night.,7.5
We booked for the Holiday Inn Express. Due to Corona this hotel is closed and the reservation is changed to the Holiday Inn a few meters further down the road. The Holiday Inn normally is much more expensive so that was a great upgrade. Due to Corona we were obliged to have breakfast at exactly 11h00. The only other option was to get a breakfast kit and eat it somewhere else. This is totally unexceptable when you have a whole day planned ahead of you and hope to have a good breakfast at the hotel!,7
personal should be more cleanbreakfast ,7.9
The staff was super friendly and accommodating all precaution measures related to the pandemic were perfectly put in place. I didnt need the drilling sounds of the works in the lobby before 8am.,8
 Rooms noisy. Could overhear the neighbor on the phone and follow complete conversation.Breakfast too standard and cheap,6.7
Good central location parking in front of hotel very practical room and bathroom.  Breakfast ok but still influenced by corona measures.,8
Great location. Friendly helpful welcoming and accommodating staff with good customer service plus they all speaks in English. The best breakfast buffet. Especially thanks to Ms. NINA so kind and approachable. I think its just the A/C in our room. But i just have noticed a day before i left so i didnt have much time to report it. but somehow it was cooling properly at first.,10
We get upgraded to the new rooms and their very trendy and cozy. Liked the Croissants..:) A/C was not activated yet so no climate system.,9
The location is perfect the comfort is ok the breakfast was top (the best taking in count covid19 rules) All was good,9
Good value place to stay. Beds comfy. Clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Nearby underground parking cost 2 euros per hour (1 euro per hr evening) up to maximum 16 euros within 24 hrs. Discovered what other reviewers meant when they said it was hard to find this place due to one way system.  There were 3 of us in car navigating using both car Satnav and google maps on phone but stymied by ongoing roadwork disruptions.   In the end we ditched the car somewhere near enough to hotel and walked got map & instructions from hotel staff about how to find the underground parking.  Thankfully didnt get parking ticket meantime. Could do with some better access instructions when booking.,9.2
Great location nearby to central railway station and easy connection to E313 highway. Decent room all needed facilities in place nice personnel.  Hasselt city center is very nearby. ,10
Because we had to leave early in the morning 530  I asked because i paid for it to take it with mee and they didnt so i paid fore nothimg nreakfast i would like it back . Regards ,7
it was near the city and the receptionist is very attentive to what you asked her. Breakfast was superb. i didnt like the bed. it was 2 bed become 1  when i specifically put one bed in the app.,10
Cleanliness. Staff. Breakfast. No parking,8
The breakfast was good. A plus would be if during the coronacrisis the breakfast was brought to the room. The room was very hot inside and when you slept with the window open there was alot of noise from the street.,9
Friendly staffs. The location restaurants/cafes are on walking distance. Nice (buffet) breakfast worth the price. Good matras to sleep on. Ik heb goed geslapen! Hard to find parking. The toilets in the lobby werent the clean. There was a bit mold on our shower door.,8
Good location Not so clean there were spider webs in the corners of the room. There was also the food smell in the morning even though we were on the third floor. ,7
The room was great and exceeded my expectations the breakfast was great too. The only qualm I have is that when I forgot to reserve a time for breakfast the personnel didnt put in much effort to find a solution. We were happy to sit outside but they said its impossible to set it up. How difficult can it be to wipe a table? I was alone with two kids and really would have appreciated a little more forthcoming in this situation.,9
Breakfast was good. Good location. Family friendly.. The rooms are little bit small but its ok for a business hotel..,10
The rooms are functional and have everything one needs. The staff is very friendly and the location (between cathedral and yacht harbour) great to explore Hasselt. The breakfast was good but not great and not fully Corona proof (cutlery in one big box for everyone to grab one. Fruit salad was taken by everyone using the same spoon). ,8
The breakfast was good and care was taken with regard to hygiene (wrapped food requests to wear face masks at the buffet spaced out tables). The room was a fair size and comfortable - just what one needs for a short stay and comfort. Very well located near the canal just a stones throw from the city centre with its shops and restaurants with easy access to some large and safe underground parking lots. ,8
Overall good stay though there were some dogs barking which was annoying. As some guests had checked in with their pets ,10
Property itself was OK with good value for money. Overall we didnt spend too much time in the hotel as we arrived late at night immediately went to bed and left directly in the morning. The staff during check-in (John) was very unfriendly sometimes even arrogant. He spoke to us in a highly unprofessional matter (ha thats no proof everyone can show me something like that! when he couldnt find our booking in the system and I showed him the booking confirmation). He also addressed us inappropriately (e.g. Menneke). We really didnt feel welcomed at the property.,5
space 2 double beds couldnt get it warmer then 18 degrees. evening after eating entered . was 16 only ! whole hotel cold. in swimming pool. in restaurant in morning also not too warm.,6
Great location Very friendly and helpful staff The bed was extremely comfortable The room was very clean  The swimming pool needs renovation and was too cold The breakfast was simple (maybe due to COVID-19 restrictions) The room was too hot because of the fact that the air conditioning wasnt working how it should be. ,8
Location A bit run down as a hotel with very expensive parking.,5
The hotel looks very fresh.  Everything is new and clean.  The staff are very welcoming and friendly.  I will definitely come back here ,10
Good Location comfortable pillows fair breakfast and friendly staff. Bathroom smells and facilities ,5.8
Very nice and helpful staff both at the reception and at the restaurant.Comfortable family room. Great pillows.Amazing breakfast.  On 2nd floor in family room its nice to have curtains on a bathtub. Friends on 3rd floor had newer bathroom.But that hasnt changed our preception of a great stay.,10
We enjoyed the friendliness of the staff. Enough choice with the breakfast sadly due to the corona measures not been able just to sit and enjoy the breakfast. Room was lovely. And the hotel was execellent located : near the shopping street :) The airco in the room wasnt sufficient for us it didnt cool down as it should do. And it would be nice to have 2 chairs in the room instead of 1.,9
Very well organized and very friendly Nothing,9
Everything Nothing everything was perfect,10
Room was good. Good variety at breakfast also good brasserie (service was also good). Child-friendly hotel (jumping castle in one of the conference rooms brasserie lounge area provided kids toys).  Check in/out was prompt. Hotel very close to shopping streets (pre) and good restaurants(Het MagazijnCjan Orangerie). Free parking around the marina area otherwise underground parking across the hotel. Prompt service when there was an issue with one of the beds. Room was above the breakfast area so when they start the morning service theres sounds of doors opening/closing furniture moved about.,9.6
Friendly staff. Very clean. Perfect location. The pool was freezing. Could have been a few degrees warmer.,10
Clean hotel and helpful staff- good location Everything was just great,10
It was very calm and beautiful. The pool was very nice too unfortunately the sauna was closed because of the Covid-19. But i enjoyed every moment in the hotel. The television had a HDMI port but it didnt work. I had to some things with my computer and i needed a bigger screen for it but it isnt such a big deal.,7
The staff is extremely friendly. Really extremely friendly. We found a sweater from someone else in our room.. That makes us questioning how good the room was cleaned but hey everybody makes a mistake from time to time,8
Suitable for families as there are swimming pool fitness and sauna.  The families rooms a little bit small,7.5
The waffles were great! The hot breakfast choice was somewhat limited,10
confortable beds good and various breakfast good location the restaurant has a very good and fresh food.  The mini bar is empty you have to fill it from reception. The furniture needs an update. We handnt bathrobe to use for swimingpool not even towels. ,7.1
Service personal is superkind and great !  Great people ! ,9.2
Staff was very helpful and friendly! We liked the pool this was big enough for kids to play and adults to swim. The breakfast and dinner were nice and tasty. Clean room. Extra towels for pool. Big size dispensers for shampoo and soap (ecofriendly). Parking right under lobby. Very cold changing room for pool.  The food order was incorrect for 1 person but all was tasty. They did not accept paper consumptiecheques that are specifically made for hotels and recreational businesses. No free or discount for parking.,8
great breakfast wifi comfortable room excellent location air conditioning was broken :-( during superhot week at beginning of August pool facilities were messy at the end of the day,8.8
breakfast was excellent and staff were really friendly rooms could do with a update. walls felt damp and sticky in our room room was more expensive than usual because of the festival.,7.1
Very comfortable bed. The kids like the swimming pool very much. Although it is small but its enough for the kids. It does not has the free packing,8.3
Nice renovation Dutch receptionist in a Flemish city. She wasnt able to help French guests.,7
The employees were always helpful and could be contacted 24/7. Place of the hotel is also very handy between both water and the busy shopping street. The parking lot was quite pricey but on the other hand it was handy having direct access to it. Overall definitely a great visit and I can only recommend it.  As a small critic point maybe one or two drinks (even just water) could have been included in the mini bar within the room. Also a discount on the parking lot if possible for people that have visited the hotel. ,9
The personnel was very kind ans professional ans the hotel is very good. If i come back to Hasselt i know where to sleep. Bravo ,8
Nice breakfast spacious room for family of four. Swimming pool and sauna. Close to city center Rooms are a bit outdated and needs renovation.   The health and leisure was not clean..,8
Staff were very helpful Trays left outside the room werent taken away until the next day.. causing the corridor to be rather smelly. No glasses in the roomRoom was very hot and cooling system didnt help much. No room service  had to pick up meals from downstairs. ,8
Good size of the beds Very shaby funiture and bathroom in the morning the personnel was extraordinaryly slow,5.4
The breakfast was good however there were no hot meals (omelet or bacon or sausages) because of Covid. For the rest it was rich enough and tasteful. The bread variety was high and the coffee was good enough. The room was not very clean and there was not enough toilet paper and no free parking although there is a cooperation with the parking nearby we would like to get a kind of promotional price as customers of the hotel.,8
Everything was great. Food was great both at the hotel restaurant and breakfast with room-service (price-included). Ventilation in the room was helpfull during hot summer night. Swimming pool elevator straight from underground parking etc. It was a pleasure. More channels on room TV? Nothing else comes to mind..,10
 Room was very cold. Temperature setup was not working,6.7
Nice comfortable clean hotel with friendly service and a good breakfast and restaurant ,9.2
Very good location big rooms and a very comfortable bed. The room was way too warm and could not get cooler despite the airco and the opened windows. Value for money could be better in general.,6
Really nice breakfast nice to have the swimming pool open even during the corona time Swimming pool was somewhat dirty and quite dark we had to wait an additional 30 minutes upon arriving before our room was ready,9
That it was in the middle of the shopping area so I could easely drop off my stuff and go back out to shop some more. The staff were very friendly and they offered service safely with acordance of the coronavirus guidlines wich is hard to do. So I apreciated that. The room was too hot at night I figured out I could change the temerature in the middle of the night and turned on the airconditioner. But it made a lot of noise and was slow to work. So the first part of the night I was hot and it was noisy. And the second part (afther I woke up later) it was cold and quite.,9
Everything was clean new cute and the staff amazing. We loved. The only point is that is not that close to the beach but its close to the market and so nice. We had a wonderful time and look forward to come back! (They were so nice to let our pug to stay with us) ,10
The location was top we stayed at a bungalow with 2 little kids. The bungalow was small but cute. Each room had its own shower & toilet which was a big plus. We stayed in March the weather didnt allow us to enjoy the terras & the garden. I think in the summer its a great place for families to stay. The play ground for the kids is small,9
A perfect stay - great modern cottages well equiped super clean quiet surroundings. A short bicycle ride away from the city center and the beach.  Loved having a terrace with table and chairs and a even a small garden with comfy sofa. Everything is very well thought of. The tetritory of the cottage could use a little fence from the camping road - it would stop toddlers from running off :),9.6
The accommodation was of a high standard and the staff have done a great job with cleanliness of the facilities. Breakfast was served in the room and had something for all tastes. ,9
Great value for money good location near the Sportoases and train station but city center is also very near. Its 20 minutes nice walk to the beach ,9
The site is good friendly people and the site is in an excellent position for the train station tram line and not to far from the beach. The mattress was not comfortable at all.,8.3
Good breakfast fresh coffee which was delivered at the time as we liked to have it in the morning. 2 Bathrooms bed was good too 2 showers hot water and good heating. Weather was OK. There was only local television. No international channels for example no news in English or German. Price for a longer stay too high more than 200 dollar or swiss franks per night. Otherwise good value.,8
Two isolated bedrooms with own baths.Nicely equipped kitchen. No airco price is a bit expensive ,9.2
Cottage was clean warm and comfortable. Breakfast brought to door at 9 am it was very tasty.  ,8.8
Great cottage very cleandelicious breakfast wonderful service great location  ,8
The reception was difficult as it was not staffed on arrival or departure. Some one to speak to.,9.2
The bungalows are very cosy neat and well maintained. It has everything you need. Usually these sorts of places are worn down and they tend to disappoint but this place is excellent! Cant think of anything..,9
Breakfast is very good: a lot of choice (bread viennoiseries juice fruits..) brought at your door according to the time you have requested The camping site is not very nice and along the road but there was no noise. The bungalow itself was very nice,9
Very clean calm green very helpful staff/owners at the reception with a cosy playground for all ages. Walking distance from the centre of Knokke and the railways station. Bikes for rent available. ,9.6
perfect location next to the main trainstation. Staff is friendly and helpful. Got a bigger room than booked and had a good sleep. Everything is basic as to be expected at a hostel but well organised clean and quiet. all good.,9
Breakfast was great the location is fantastic when coming with the train and you can walk into the centre pretty quickly. Extremely nice staff very helpful! The rooms could be a bit more cozy concerning the decoration etc. But that is just an extra after all it is a hostel so a clean sleeping place is great! Also good thing was that the bathroom and shower were separate but still in the room so no weird through the hallway walking for a shower. Very nice! The matresses were indeed a bit hard but I dont think its a big deal since this is a hostel which was great good price in comparison to others and it was very clean. A bit more decoration could be nice as the rooms were a bit cold but that is just a very small thing.,8
breakfast was good. The location is really good. ,7.9
Everything was like we expected it to be. Basic but clean. Great location nearby the city centre. The staff is also available for every question you have. ,8.8
Close to the train station decent beds There is no kitchen or microwave you could use. Which is a bit shame for a hostel. And WiFi was only in common areas and not in the rooms,7.5
The staff does all to please there gasts. There is enough choice for the breakfast.  the rooms are big and it is nice that the toilet and shower is on the room and not in the corridor. ,8.8
Decent hostel next to the train station with all the basic amenities you would expect from a hostel. Rooms have space and hangers to put your stuff. Same with bathroom. There are recycling bins. Kitchen seems to be lacking. The check-in took quite long. I stood there about 15 minutes waiting for the two people in front of me and this is not the first time. I would really recommend some automatic/self check-in system. People should just get their keys upon arrival. There is nothing complicated in the hostel.,8.3
Close to the train station and comfortable stay. Breakfast is great too! ,9.6
Extremely helpful staff despite my flight was delayed and would not make it for check in on time they offered me an alternative and saved my trip. They had anything necesary for a comfortable stay and nice and varied common areas to relax and work. The matress was the worst part enough for a couple of nights and only one working socked in the room to charge things despite being for 6 people..,9.2
Great location! I forgot how things work in hostels (making my bed by myself no toiletries or towels in the room except for toilet paper) but thats my problem. I paid more for a private room than I would have in a 1-star hotel with all the usual service but there was no choice at the time of booking.,7.5
It was near the train station. I recommend to those that love to talk and sher the roum ) The handkercheefs missing near the sink also the soap was innexistent/missing. Also it was good a garbedge in the room not only in the bath ),9.6
Showed in the bedroom is really good. The common area close after 23:00. No place to have a seat to do some leisure stuff. And the WiFi signal is only at the common area.  The signal at bedroom area is very weak.,8.3
Friendly staff. Beds are not jerky. Location is excellent.  No free parking in the Hostel,9.6
Cosy warm regular hostel breakfast  The showers are private but you dont have a flow regulator,9.2
the room is nice. it exceeds my expectation regarding to the cleanliness.  the staff is so nice.  they helped me a lot. the hostel also provides the breakfast breakfast is also good under this cost. the location just behind the train station and bus station just 1 or 2 mins walk. check in and check out time is limited from 3pm and 10am if you come early you have to wait until 3pm,8.3
Great location helpful staff good free breakfast. Dont miss the Friday market. That we cant bring pizza to enjoy in the courtyard.,8.3
Very friendly and helpful stuff no soap or anything else in the bathrooms. Breakfast was ok but quite basic.,7.9
I like the Staff which is very happening and welcoming. I like the Services provided by the staff members. There is no Wi-Fi available in the rooms due to which we have to face a lot of trouble to come down for a single call or video chats with our family. Even If we have to check mail or access internet we have to go downstairs.,7.9
The room was fine and we really appreciated the staff member letting us check in after hours. We were a group of 7 and were only provided with limited swipe cards for the out of hours entrance/back door. To top it off a couple of the swipe cards we were given didnt even work leaving people in our group stranded outside (women alone at different times) in the middle of the night not the safest.,6.7
Nice breakfast and clean room. Spacious room (2 persons) such we even could stall our bicycles in it.  Bed comfort typical and same in every youth hostel. I dont like the plastic mattress but was know in advance :-),8
Garden! Internet is not work really nice:(,9.6
The location of this hostel is very good close to the city center close to train stations etc. The (double) room we received was very large and so was the bathroom. At checkin we received free linens which took only a few minutes to install. Towels are not free (the rent price was low though). Breakfast wasnt very varied but it was ok. The most pleasant surprise was at checkout which we had specified to be very early in the morning. The evening before they offered us breakfast to-go (each got a paper bag with mostly the same items that you get at regular breakfast). We appreciated this very much. ,9.2
My stay was excellent. The staff is great and helpful. Its comfortable and clean with a good mix of people. They also provide big lockers to ensure the safety of your valuables which is a big plus for me. The location is quite convenient too- the brussels central station is just about a few minutes walk. Lovely decor! ,9.6
There was a very large selection  for breakfast .. realy! even waffles not like in a hostel 5 minutes to the biggest attractions very modest room unused space lined with oilcloth in the bathrooms you can see the time - unwashed tiles and a down yellow shower curtain.,7.5
The breakfast was good excellent room. No towels provided no saop and no champo.,9.2
Centrally located to most brussels attractions the 2 single beds room is huge and comfy ,10
 near a very dangerous area of the city and the receptionist is incredibly rude! dont even think about taking your phone out to ask directions because hell flip out for some bizzare reason. not worth your money!!,2.9
Very comfortable and staff very kind location is perfect . This hostel doesnt have shampoo or soap.,9
The hostel have amazing quality the breakfast was  amazing they also provided flavor water with fresh fruit in the reception Nothing,10
Very nice and accommodating staff and very fluent in multiple languages which was great for me and my girlfriend! ,10
 wifi was not working at all during our stay,8.3
Very nice friendly staff beside the hostel location is really central and on can walk to most of the city attractions ,10
I like breakfast. Toilets and shower room are disaster. Water was everywhere.,7
Spacious room. Clean accommodation. There were attempts to make breakfast interesting. Staff was friendly and helpful. Nothing stands out though a fridge for guests to use would be perfect.,8.8
Basically in the center of the city - I recommend this hostel if you want to make short 1 day trips to Brugge or Gent as its very close to Brussel Central train station.Friendly staff good bar with a wide variety of beers.Extra points for the bartender ).Cozy spaces for chill small lounges at every floor and a big one near the reception Shower is a bit weird but ok :)Breakfast could be much better - better if you can include some meat too,8.3
price place. if you need one night stand you can survive this its a bit dirty. bed and mattress covered in strange plastic. breakfast is pretty bad,7.1
Location is good 10 mins walk from Brussels central but the entrance is bit pain as you need to detour around building.Breakfast is ok but no meat at all(hamsausages) Shower room is annoying You have to constantly press the button to keep water runningI understand this is to save water but at least make it longerTherere no sign or anything say which way is toilet or shower room,6.7
Good location friendly staff. I was here allready in summer time and it was nice to come back. Maybe a little more offer for breakfast.,8
The room is cozy and comfortable staffs are helpful and the location is great. The water of shower is really cold. 1 Euro is needed to use lockers in the room but it will be returned afterwards.,9.6
They had a very spacious double room. Location was perfect pretty accessible to the city center. There was a safe deposit for your valuables in the room. The bed had stains on the sheets. The bathroom had no drain so every time we showered there would be puddles on the floor til it basically evaporated on its own. Just your average breakfast of toast jams and eggs. Lady staff was quite obnoxious.,6.7
Large room good lockers coin operated friendly staff lots of older travellers. No soap in the bathroom and no handbasin in the separate shared toilet. Very noisy no double glazing or air conditioning. Nowhere to prepare food nowhere to store food. Beds and pillows with plastic covers. No sanitary bins in the bathroom.,7.5
Amazing location. Had a big room with a bathroom very basic but functional. Friendly and helpful staff. A small bar in the cellar and inner yard as well. Ok breakfast nothing special but as expected. Overall great value for money! Basic single beds were not too comfortable and furniture a bit shabby.,9.2
Top Location and very friendly. Theyve been preparing a lunch package because I had to leave early. ,10
Clean rooms young and friendly atmosphere nice personnel at the reception. ,10
Hostel not too far from train station. Good staff even I check in at 1am. Bed was soft. Its always lound. I always heard people walking around close the door and open the door whole night. I cant even sleep. Shower room and toilet at my floor are broken cant use it.,7.9
People  - staff  :) really nice and helpfull! Too loud. Not so clean. Shower were broken (3 showers two broken one mens oki) on the one floor! (a lot of rooms),6.7
The hostel was 10 minutes walking from Brussels Central. Breakfast was very good and there was variety. Friendly service. There was also a room where you could leave your luggage and pick them later. Sheets could be cleaner.,9.6
Staff were more than expected very helpful and cheering special thanks to Doppy and the reception lady unfortunately i dont know her name to thank her  There is no shared kitchen no gathering time ,8.3
Well-locatedCleanGood Breakfast Towels excluded,10
The room is clean all facilities are great. Good value for money Just the church bell rang so loud in the morning. It woke me up around 6 am,8.3
everythings website should tell how to get to hostel via smooth road to roll the baggage,9.6
I was traveling alone but I became friends with girls from my dorm thanks to the hostel !  The personnel were super sweet. Plus the bed were really confortable we had lockers for our stuff. It was great ! ,9
The location was prime really easy to get around and the staff were really friendly! Would definitely stay here again.  There was a little smell in our room during our first night but it went away as soon as we had the windows open. ,9.2
Breakfast is surprisingly good nice variety of cheeses. Wifi is simply to establish and rooms are nice and clean. Pillow was not very comfortable to sleep on,8
Close to the city center. Very kind and funny receptionist. There was no meat for breakfast.,10
Good breakfast and location. There was often no soap in the soap dispensers.,7.9
Room was clean good breakfast location and bar No hot water in every morning and staff said that we need to wait but it was still cold after an hour.,8.8
Tasty breakfast nice clean rooms and helpful service. ,9
It was good. Cool hostel to spend the night and carry on. The breakfast was cool and the accommodations good. Nice location too. RAS,7.9
The breakfast was good for a hostel We have to arrange our own beds the restroom was not really clean during my stay. It could be better for the price ,7.1
Really nice breakfast and its location is really good! Only 2 toilets per flat,7.9
Facilities are new. We got a private and big room.  We had our own shower but the toilet was part.  Location was good The kitchen was pretty messy and nobody cleaned,9
Was a very pretty room and really good breakfast! Nothing to complain about! :),10
The best breakfast I have ever seen in a hostel good selection of bread fruits etc..juice machine coffee machine amazing!10 out of 10 ,8.8
It was really cold and the guy in the front desk gave us hot water and we could make some tea. ,8.3
Breakfast was good. WC was outside the room even though they said it had bathroom inside no towels and shower has temporizer no soap or shampoo in the room. ,7
The hostel pays attention to my specific request.  I requested for a lower bed.  They print out a paper reserving my bed in the room. Which makes me feel personalized. Despite the personalization  they have make a SERIOUS  MAJOR mistake..  I booked a bed in a 4 bedded FEMALE ONLY dorm only to find out the next morning that my room mate was a GUY.  Thank God nothing happen to me that night.  Its not about the MONEY here. Its about the safety of your clients!  If i dont mind sharing a room with a guy  i would book a mixed dorm.  Because I dont feel comfortable and safe  i booked a bed in a FEMALE ONLY dorm..  So this kind of error is totally unacceptable.  I dont feel safe and I feel like the property x bother about my safety issue even after I complaint at the reception.,8.3
central location friendly stuff Very dirty. Dusty. Seems like room was not cleaned after previous guest,7.1
space and overall outlook separate sheets,8.8
Very dirty and noisy room. The worst hotel I have ever been to. ,3.3
Really clean. All the furniture has a really good maintenance. The location is great. The food in breakfast is good as well. There are a bar and a outdoor common areas where you can have talks with other people. Also it was the quiet enough to sleep well. Warm days could be a little bit tricky there because there is not a cooler system (no other hostel where Ive been has had though). Coffee could be better.,9.2
Needed a place to stay near the train station and this was great in terms of distance and value. Decent free breakfast Nothing,10
I like basically everything in the Bruegel Hostel. The bed has light and electric outlet for each. The bathroom is clean. There are lockers in the room. And they use card to enter the room which is very safe. Most importantly the breakfast is terrific! Its the best hostel Ive stayed so far! And its only several minutes walk to central station and the Grand Place. All is good only there is a snoring roommate but that is hostel.,10
Is cheap and well located. Good staff. Nice room. Nothing. Everything was good.,7.5
The breakfast was really really really good. So many options including gluten free things.  Bathrooms were pretty dirty and with bad smell.From my room we could hear everything happening on the street til night ,7.5
Staff very helpful breakfast great taxi back to bus prompt with staff helping to call and accomodating due to bathroom shower on the floor being our of order. ventilation - could smell the other guests,7.5
Great location comfortable beds spacious and nice common spaces helpful staff Dorms doors make a lot of noise when they close few fruits selection for breakfast,8
The staffs are really enthusiastic to make your stay happy. The room toiletand shower room are very clean. The hostel itself is very convinient to walk to the Grand Palace. Because I needed to check out very early and would missed out the brrakfast time the staff was so generous to pack me the breakfast on that night. Overall my stay here was really amazing and I wish I could somehow got to extend my stay here :) ,9.6
The receptionist was very welcoming and friendly.The room was very clean and cosy. ,10
Location is in the center of Brussels really close to the Grand Place. Room was really quiet. Place and facilities are definitely clean. You dont get towels I didnt remember it was mentioned on my booking. We get back to ask for them and the reception was closed because it was probably after the hours.,7
personal light and power socket @ur bed good location tasty breakfast ,8
the atmosphere for the breakfast the big spaces the color of the bricks the wide windows internet did not work at all,8.8
Well located hostel. Less than 10 min walking to most of the main attractions. Breakfast is very good it offers a great variety of stuff. The bar downstairs is nice and not pricey at all. We had a private shower but toilets were outside and shared.,9
Nice hostel in a very good location - close to the city center and train station Gare du Midi room is very clean and big enough nice lounge area tasty breakfast and good working wifi. Bathroom is too small especially shower that is not so much comfortable during use.,8.8
Excellent Breakfast. Very clean room. Value for the money. Very near to Bruexel Central station. ,10
The lockers are big and easy to use. The location is great. Right between the old town and the museums/palace. The shower curtains were a bit short in the bathroom but thats not too bad.,10
Very friendly and very helpful staff. Exceptional cleanliness. Also the location is very good just 5 min walk to Manneken Pis and ¬±7 min to The Grand Place. Rooms with street view are really noisy at night time.,8.3
The location is superb. Walking distance from the Grand Place and there is a beautiful church nearby. Friendly staff who are always smiling and are ready to help. No bathroom in the room as mentioned but thats common and it didnt bother me.,9.6
The staff were amazing. There was an welcoming open area for group activities. Breakfast was superb with a variety of foods and drinks. Nothing.,10
I liked the bedbugs. I didnt like the fact that no wifi was not working. They give vey little water to shower and hot water.The staff is somewhat kind extremely strict like you work for them.Very expensive for what it is.  I did like there was heating in the room and workedBuy a towel that is not new and you will leave it there for sur that you paye for 6euros.lol,3.8
The breakfast was a prefect way to start the morning. Staff were very helpful and informative. Fantastic location for getting around the city. People drinking outside of the building at night made alot of noise. The window had to be kept opened because of the summer heat.,10
Great location - only minutes from the centre.  Friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast.  Luggage room available if you need to store your suitcase before check-in Theres a bar onsite! Room was really hot and bathroom sink and shower was dirty. The bunk beds werent comfortable.,8.3
Location of this hostel is nice. Staff was welcoming. Breakfast was good. Only 1 shower on the floor for guests.,8.8
Good location staff very cool The price could be a bit lower,9.6
 Beds are to small for tall People. The board at the end of the bed prevents you from sticking your feet out.,7
Great hostel! Very clean spacious room wonderful breakfast included! Very good location close to the Central Station 5mins by walking and the center. Totally recommended!! ,9.6
Very good facilities. Lockers in room. Good sensitive lighting in room. Sockets by each bed. Nice indoor and outdoor communal space. Breakfast was ok. ,7.9
Good location and great facilities Pay extra for towelThere wasnt hand soap in the bathroom ,8.3
The breakfast was of good quality even though not so many choices. The location was great 600m from the center and central station. We got a really noisy room the first 2 nights it was impossible to sleep. After the first night we asked to change it and since they didnt have free rooms they changed our room only for the last night. The rooms could be much cleaner,7.1
Attached shower and toilet for the 2 bed dorm. Good location. The bowls and cutlery at breakfast were not clean enough due to years of usage.,7.1
Location is good staffs are good rooms are clean beds are comfortable plugs are enough for everyone. There are lockers for each guests but you have to put 1$ to lock and when you use it you can get back. Everything was ok. I really recommend it.  Breakfast was a little bit insufficient but it was ok.,9.6
It was a very pleasant stay. Very friendly and multilingual staff Easy check-in and check-out Several minutes walk from the Grand Plaza A nice church right next to it Nice breakfast Wish the Wifi could work better,8.3
Breakfast adequate. Planned to meet people in the bar but it did not open on my Sunday.,9.6
 Quality of the breakfast should be better..,9.6
Superb location spacious room clean bathroom. Beds OK breakfast OK. Not sure why but the staff was a bit.. unfriendly.,8
It was really quiet and comfy I couldnt have choose a better place to stay ,10
Central position good price helpful stuff A bit dirty,9
my room was bright and clean i would have enjoyed a television,8
Smart breakfast clean and comfortable room. Nice location. Great personals. Nothing,10
location is great . not that much clean.,7.5
I liked the en suite shower. Good breakfast nice variety. ,7.5
Stayed for one night. The hostel is much better in person than on the pictures here. The rooms and the shared areas were spic and span. Its also an easy walk from Brussels Central and Grand Palace. The timed lights in the bathroom and shower.,8.8
Location is great! A lot of nice places nearby just walking. The whole place is very clean and tidy. The common areas are confortable. You can leave your belongs there even after the check-out. Plus: the church in front is lovely totally worth it to visit ,8.8
Staff were very friendly and the location is superb The shower didnt have pressure the beds were  extremely uncomfortable and at night it was very cold. ,6.3
Location people nice breakfast amazing staff. Annoying light in bathroom that turns off every 5 seconds.,9.6
The location was very good for the value. It is close to all main sights so you do not need to use any kind of transport. The breakfast was very basic but alright: toasts eggs nutella jams etc. The twin room was clean and good size. We asked for the double room but still two twin beds were given. The beds were quite uncomfortable and also the triangle roof is very close to your head so be careful while getting up from the bed. Regarding the shower you need to push the button every 7-10 seconds for the constant water flow.,7.9
Really good hostel nice staff a cosy place to stay. Breakfast included and the hostel ist really close to the centre. Nothing to complain.,9.2
Hostel was clean. I stayed in a 4-bed room and there was a small shower in the room (the door has a gap so its not really private however its only a shower) which I personally dont like much as it only creates more noises if someone showers early/ late. But thats my personal opinion. .. They have a nice garden area and its close to the city centre.The breakfast is great. I expected toast and butter but they also have some fruits cereals eggs coffee (specialists) and tea.  as above shower in the room.The mattresses have a kind of plastic protection I guess to make it more hygienic/ easier to clean. It wasnt for as I didnt sleep very well on those and its also noisy when moving around.,7.5
Very clean. Nice helpful staff. The beds were not very comfortable and taking a shower while keeping the bathroom light on required speed and dexterity.,7.5
The breakfast selection was small but perfectly adequate.  Staff were friendly.  Bathroom facilities were clean. I would recommend this hostel to anyone. I was in a 4-bed dorm but had the place to myself can imagine if it was full it would be quite cramped and stuffy!,9
Breakfast location Everything unless breakfast and location,6
The hostel is very clean quite and has an excellent location. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Nothing,10
Spacious room and location close to art museum. The room was hot at night didnt sleep enough. One of the staff guys was rude and laughed at me at the reception. Its was too overpriced for what it is. The breakfast is all sugar.,2.5
Although it was further than I thought it would be it was just still a manageable 7-10 minute walk to Brussels Central train station. The size of the room and ensuite bathroom in the double room just surprised us as we thought it would be smaller. The breakfast option could be improved. Only toast cereal and a couple of fruits are your options.,9
4 bed dorm size is goodFree printing of boarding passes Accessing the hostel from the shuttle bus stop can be difficult - 20 mins walk through a very rough area can be dangerous at night. The toilets never had toilet paper in them we had to constantly go down to the receptionist and complain about it.The breakfast is very basic and the dining area tends to get over crowded so Id recommend going early for breakfast. ,6.3
The room and washroom were clean. bed was bit smaller in size.,7.5
The location is amazing. Staff is really nice and helpful. Breakfast is very good! They give you a breakfast bag if you checkout before breakfast hour. ,10
 We would have liked tea making facilities (cups or mugs tea bags milk & boiling water) to be available at any time.,7.5
Everything otherwise was great great value for money as well The beds could be taller theyre a little bit small for a tall guy,8
Friendly staffGood location Heater didnt work well,9
Great low cost accommodation in Brussels. Good location and breakfast is included. All was fine,9.2
On the plus side the hostel is in a great location and they let us store the bags until check-in. But the breakfast was deplorable there was so soap at the bathroom. The interior was not very homey but good enough. It tried to be a hip place from the decorations but failed in my opinion.,6.3
Location. Cleanliness. Breakfast. You have to remove and leave the sheets at the desk at checkout thats pure idiotic thing. Receptionist she was not welcoming. ,4
Cleaned  Organised The kitchen facilities Could not be used during afternoon and night.,9
The staff are kind and helpful. Breakfast is good. The hotel is clean and has a lift. The duvet cover/blanket is dirty and very smelly. I hope they would wash it more often.,8.3
The staffs are very nice and helpful also provide great breakfast theres also a bar in the basement so its convenient to grab a drink :) ,10
Better than I expected it to be. Definitely recommend it. ,10
Location quite central very comfortable staff were friendly  Some of the dishes had stain on it Its so obvious on the coffee cups,8.8
The art on the walls (paintings) Everything was great thought I would appreciate if they had kitchen facilities /amenities,10
Very huge property. I like the courtyard and some of the staff. The room is very hot even with windows open. No airconditioning or electric fan inside the room. We suggest putting a pantry so that we wont disturb the staff when we need to microwave something or get some hot water.,7.5
Restaurants nearby and close to central station. our room were outside the main building and shower (for bath) is outside the room. Inside the room there is only a sink. There is no fan or ar conditioner.,5.8
For the price you are paying you wont find better. Everything you need with good quality ,8.8
Location breakfast lockers..  Only one shower by floor for mens,10
Awesome location. Clean facilities. They made an effort to place you with a same gender room. four people room.spacious rooms. Great breakfast A bit hidden,10
Spacious rooms and very clean toilets. Fantastic breakfast ,10
Very clean and well maintained. The whole hostel is big with a courtyard and common area. The rooms are not that spacious but not too small either. No access to kitchen and fridge (although the staffers say they can store your food in the fridge in their reception office I dont think that will work well and conveniently as a normal fridge for guests in a typical hostel does).,8.8
Good bar in the basement. Breakfast. Nothing really.,7
Common Area on the first floor and wifi Only one shower room on the first floor and no container for putting stuffs& weird shower head in shower room,7.1
The location is very good. Friendly staff. Poor breakfast (there is not a single ham slice) toilets were dirty you have to dress your own bed and towels are not included (6 euros for a towel!).,7.1
Its very clean room and good breakfast. Also the location is close to the train station Bruxelle Central. The staff is friendly and provide clear information. -,10
The location was great and the beds were very comfortable ,10
 the wifi didnt work properly in the dorm nor in  the hall or the kitchen. The showers on my floor were broken so i had to use the ones on the second floor and in the shower there was not even a hook to hand your clothes/ bathrobe The 4 bed dorm was too small,5.4
Nice staff good location and average breakfast. Bad internet connection not accessible even from 1st floor. There wasnt any soap and towels and there isnt any information about this. Sheets were extremely old and dirty there was holes and stains. It doesnt deserve the price.,5.4
The location of the hostel is great just 3 minutes away from central train station. The hostel rooms was ok in terms of cleaning but shared bathrooms and toilets need a bit more cleaning. Sinks were dirty.,8.3
Location good for the price we paid. Room to the front.. very noisy.,6.7
The building itself is nice with a pleasant courtyard. The staff were friendly. Cold water served at reception which was a nice touch. It is in a good area and easy to reach from the Eurostar. Breakfast was fine. We took 3 rooms for a work trip.  One of the rooms was fine but the other two on floor 3 were effectively greenhouses / conservatories. The fully glazed elevation had two tiny openable windows. With the heatwave it was impossible to sleep in there. We managed to move one room but two of our team had a very poor nights sleep. These rooms should be discounted or not used in the heat as they are not habitable.,8.3
Good heating system good location friendly staff it was ok for our needs we got at 20:00 and left at 530 morning very basic Its not a well kept hostel as the perfect one we were in Amsterdam (stayokey) the common area is poor not even water the bed in room is shakey and the blanket and pillow low quality however the heating was good and we had a good night sleep the windows wasnt soundproof lots of noise from the street,7.9
Extremely suprised by the quality / price ratio! Definitely worth staying for a low budget Brussels trip. ,10
Good location great friendly staff comfortable bed big room and good breakfast..everything was really good I highly recommended. ,10
Its very big and nice They dont give towels,10
Facility has everything a person needs for comfortable stay great location nice breakfast Everything was ok,10
Great location for budget travelling. You can walk to most of attraction from here. Moreover the double room we stayed was very spacious and simple. Found blood mark on my duvet made me feel uneasy.,7
Breakfast included in price was great. Friendly staff. Clean and tidy. No kitchen facilities to use. Couldnt make a hot drink. Showers in one bathroom not able to be used. Not very homely. Probably more suited to large sports/school groups,8.3
We really like location and staff very friendly. ,9.2
Friendly and helpful staff clean bedrooms nice breakfast great location! Certainly I would stay here again. I needed to print my boarding pass and they did that for free. They deserve 5 stars. Nothing,10
THE BREAKFAST WAS IDEAL AND CONTINENTAL WHICH MISSED ME COS I LIVE AND WORK IN THE UK. The such breakfast is impossible in the UK.  The Hostel Bruegel has high standard and acceptable prices. The place of the hostel was ideal for walking tour activity very close to The Upper city Brussels  Royal Palace and Month de Arts and the same time 10 minutes away from The Lower city Brussels and Gare de Midi. ,10
The location is perfect the hostel in general looks clean and decent the breakfast is also fine. We had a strange smell in a room and had to open the window each time we enter the room was smaller comparing to the phootos available,8.3
Breakfast included. Super clean. Lovely staff. ,8.3
Electric socket for each bed. Very pleasant district. Clean showers and toilet. Dusty floor. There is a shower in room with private bathroom but toilet is shared.,8
My stay was great.  Although the hostel is centrally located it was really quiet and cozy there.  The staff is very helpful and friendly the breakfast was ok. The only thing is we have got the upper floor room so it was a bit hot in the daytime. ,9
Its location is not bad. The breakfast offered its quite complete (bread fruit juice tea coffee chocolate butter philadelphia eggs jam). Staff is nice we asked for a hair dryer and they kindly lend us one. We were able to leave the luggage in the luggage room free of charge after leaving the room. The shower didnt last for too long and you had to be pushing the button every 30 seconds. That was a bit annoying.  At the end of our stay we had to leave the blankets in reception so a bag to take them all there would have been appreciated.,7.1
I had to travel to Brussels to do interviews for my thesis and stayed at this hostel all three times. The location is great I could walk to all of my appointments at the EP and Commission. The rooms are clean and otherwise quite okay. Desk in the room was perfect so I could work a bit. Not loud but I might just have been lucky with my roommates all three times. Free breakfast is basic but perfectly OK. Safe to walk outside at night easy to find and easy to find places to eat around here. Good locker to keep your stuff in. Staff was not overly friendly and well its pretty basic. You get what you pay for.,7.9
The atmosphere and the position aree great. You can easily reach different important places in few minutes (the grand place is only 10 minutes by foot). There are different restaurants around for everyone. The room and bathrooms are clean. The breakfast was not as I expected. It was small with few things. It is the only one negative thing I could find during my journey.,10
Good location close to the train station and metro line as well as within walking distance to the city center. Nice and helpful staff good spacious room and bathroom and large locker as well as free luggage store. Large common areas inside and outside in a courtyard. Good breakfast. ,9
The staff is really friendly and helpful. The place is clean and bright the room was big. Water ir private shower was a little bit too cold. Even on max hot temperature level water was chilly.,9.6
The location is good. Very close to one of the train stations and close to the old town. The breakfast is good and there is a locker inside the room but you have to use 1 euro to use it (you can take it back after you open it). There is also a supermarket very close to the hostel where you can get a nice packed salad or other food. It is a bit hot during the summer.,8.8
Well located good structure and nice staff.  We had a problem with our AirBnb and we had to take a last minute room in Brussels Michael was very kind on the late check-in that we had to do. ,9.2
The bed was really good and the area where the hostel is located it is very quiet. Near to the city center and to the Midi Station. ,8.8
You were only an 8 min walk from the key sites. Also only a 6 minute walk to the central station.  Decent locker space. Breakfast met expectations. Lots of communal spaces. Not much around the hostel to see or do. The shower was push button which I didnt like.,7
Lounge. Charging possibilities. Breakfast Lack of coat hangers in the toilets.,8
Breakfast can take as much as we want. I meet fa lot of friends from switzerland new zealand and german..nice hostel the shower i dont like it.. kind of hard to press.. n i book for the second blanket because of cold weather.but they give me really thinny blanket,7.5
Bed staff and lounges. Fixed shower head is really a bad thing.,8.8
There were a lot of young people The ceiling fan worked all day and all night long. I asked to switch it off but at the reception they said it was not possible.,7.9
The breakfast is good The room is super hot. fan or air conditioner are not available.the toilet is dirty.,3.3
Location is central near Grand Place and Brussels Central station. Breakfast was really good no deli meats but there were about three kinds of bread some jams and sweet spreads juices and hot beverages. In room lockers were really convenient and spacious. The lockers used the kind of locks they use in museums (one where you put a 1$ coin in to lock). Staff was friendly and helpful!  The bathrooms dont have hooks or tables/stands to put clothes and toiletries on. The tissue machine in the bathroom was difficult sometimes. I didnt mind the timer in the shower but the water pressure is really low. Room was a little small and there wasnt any hand soap in the room (but there was a sink!) ,7.9
Clean rooms and hallways The beds were a little hard but price wise they were good,10
The hostel was decent and had good breakfast but will never visit again. Most rude arrogant staff. The person at the reception was very rude. I have never felt more unwelcome ever.To access the locker you need a euro coin something i wasnt informed about before. I did not have a coin and the person out rightly said we dont expect people to come here wothout money you cant access the locker this was at 10:30 in the night when it was raining outside.,1
Great value for the price. Room was big with lockers to store belongings lots of outlets. Sheets were clean and bathroom as well. Staff at the welcome desk was super friendly and immediately helped me locate a lost umbrella. Breakfast was great given it was free. ,10
friendly & helpful staffs luggage storage available good breakfast great location - near the grand place and the centre lockers available in rooms with 1$ deposit comfortable ,8.8
The highest point of the hostel is the location. Near to centre and train station. The room and the bathroom were not clean there were hair in the beds and the trash was still there. The rooms acoustic is bad. we heard everything from the street and hall.,5.8
 There are not separately bathrooms in the rooms.,8
The location is great most places are within walking distance. My god the noise was just horrible. If youre a light sleeper like myself you will not have a good night. The alle reason I wont book this accommodation again. ,5.4
Location Wi-fi didnt work well connection would crash all the time. I expected being able to keep stuff in a fridge since its a hostel but they dont have a kitchen for the guests use.,8.3
Decent buffet breakfast in the morning. Free luggage storage before check-in and also after check-out. ,9
Its was a really good location.Breakfast was nice.Room was nice and cosy Bed was sooo comfortable Gave me an umbrella when needed Shower and toilet not in the room or near my close,9.2
Staff and location. Superclean facilities rooms ok. From the breakfast I was able to eat only a boiled egg (no salt available) with basic toast and drink some coffee of a low quality. No ham fried eggs etc.  Have not seen any green tea either.. Beds were kinda small even for a small person and very soft. It was a bit too warm in the room.,7.5
The breakfast was simple but good . Location was good but i felt little scary at times The shower situation was really really bad. They need to change it ..,8.3
Clean big rooms great breakfast and nice stuffs. Nothing,9.6
breakfast was great and felt that the hostel was super modern. Well designed. the size of the lockers were a bit tricky it didnt fit my bag but other than that i was great.,10
Everything was good - nice room with a desk clean with perfect location easy check-in. The only missing thing in this hostel is some kind of a kitchen that could be used by guests (to make a tea or a sandwitch).,10
If you reserve early enough you will get a fantastic double-bed room on the 4th floor!! ,10
Breakfast and location are good. :) Noise from outside when you open your window.,9.2
Very decent hostel in the Brussels city center. No complaints!,9.2
Nice public facilities!Satisfied breakfast!Helpful and friendly staff! ,8.8
What I liked the most is the location how helpful the staff were and the cleanliness of the property. There is nothing that I disliked.,10
Very good location personal are nice and hospitable. Price includes breakfast. ,9.6
It was large and very nice Everything was okay,10
The hostel is located at a walking distance from some attractions such as Mont des Arts the Royal Museums of art and also the central station. The staff was nice. The room was clean. The breakfast was very good including cereals different milk options such as vegan breads different options of spreads for the bread cheese juice coffee/tea and fruits among other things. I didnt find something I didnt like.,8.8
Cleanliness and price/quality Everything was good,10
 There is no handwash soap provided for you!,8.3
Breakfast is included and it was good. Its close to main tour locations. ,10
Staffs are friendly. Overall it is close to station and sightseeing places Nothing,10
I liked the hostel very much. I especially liked the staff and their service and the location. I highly recommend the place. Very few toilets outside the rooms.,9.2
Good spacious place for two and clean Shower its like push the knob and water runs for three seconds they can do better timing when a person is using shower,9.2
Good location very nice and helpful staff nice price There was a wash basin in the room I stayed which was not separated so I heard the sound of the running water when others were using it in the early morning. ,8.3
Overall friendliness efficient service clean outdoor and indoor spaces to relax quiet and generally very welcoming in the Center of Bruxelles great location. ,10
Its a typical hostel. Everything there is new and looks nice. The beds are quite comfortable there is only one table in the room (we stayed in a room for 4) The breakfast is just ok. Not much to choose from,10
Excellent food way above any expectation for this type of accommodation the manager is evidently a highly trained chef and uses lots of local produce. My steak was as good as anything Ive had in an expensive city restaurant. Recommended. Accommodation is basic.,8.3
New owners beautifully decorated with lots of little extras and details. Good food and plenty of safe carpark will recommend !! ,10
Great location superb staff and wonderful food Beds were a bit soft,9.6
Great service and very good food at the restaurant. ,9.2
The place was lovely set in an old abbey I believe. You should opt to eat here as the food is fantastic and fresh each day. Staff family run were very nice and helpful. Its in a good location to explore the region and was good to come back to hotel for a great dinner each night. The location is just outside Malmedy so you need a car or bicycle to visit town center.  WiFi was not good because of the thick walls of the building but if you want to unplug its perfect.,9.6
Staff were great and really helpful being able to arrange taxis at short notice. Excellent service during afternoon & evening at the outside seating areas Off-road parking and relatively quiet location Clean + comfortable room Nothing to complain about other than being a bit too far from the town centre. Restuarant did seem expensive,9.2
Very friendly helpful owners - wonderfully clean really comfortable bed and a pretty location.  this was a lovely place to stay.  I was only overnighting but nothing was too much trouble.  Didnt get much chance to taste the food  but breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the house wine the night before was lovely. nothing,10
Malmedy is a lovely town and this hotel is just outside in the beautiful countryside.  Delicious gourmet dinner outdoors and breakfast too.  Very comfortable rooms. ,10
The guy running the place was very friendly and helpful. He seemed to be doing every job there is to do running a hotel but did it with a smile. He is also a very good chef. Nothing,8.3
Denis is a seriously good chef and is in the process of making quite a name for himself and good luck to him. This is a very charming small family run hotel. Nothing,10
We stopped off at the Hostellerie on the way back to the Netherlands from France so we could break up the journey but we ended up having an absolutely lovely end to our trip. A beautiful property in pretty grounds with top service excellent beer and a first class restaurant. Would recommend to anyone in the area.  For us it was perfect but it is roadside and Im not sure how much there is to do locally for a longer stay,9
Friendly people great location excellent breakfast  beautiful room ,10
 A little bit strange they dont speak proper English but they where very nice and willing to help. Very nice place to stay,8.8
Very welcoming staff tasty food and the style of the hotel itself. ,8.8
 The noice from the motorway. I think the window noice insulation is not the best. Or maybe it was the fresh air inlet above the window that I couldnt close?,9.2
The staff and the room Not in the vicinity of other restaurants so not many alternatives to own restaurant that is closed on Sundays,9.6
This place is a small gem and the restaurant has delicious local dishes. The staff are friendly and the room was spotless! The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. ,9.6
Clean tidy and a super Dinner in the evening Nothing,9
Restaurant : food is very good - the hotel is quiet- enough space in the room not really modern- bathroom too little- no direct WIFI !,7
Lady from the breakfast was really friendly.Good parking Spacious room Smell in the room.Situated next to highway with a lot of noise as of 0530.Breakdast is basic,7
Top hotel where everything was of a very high quality but that is matched by the prices. Room was plain and functional and spotlessly clean. The owners are friendly and very professional. Its a bit tricky to find make sure that you use the recommended address detail. Dont think about popping out for a meal or a drink as theres nothing around it.,7.9
Amazing location. 5Mins walk from the train station. Short walk to the main market place so remained quieter without too long a walk for things to do No tea and coffee making facilities. Was told to help ourselves to coffee and tea from the breakfast room (which was free) toldnthen on day 3that we shouldnt have been told that and it was in fact 5euros a cup! I have never ever heard of a hotel not offering free hot drinks!,8.8
Location is really nice its easy to walk everywhere. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed that Ive ever been slept. It was a double room and there was two different mattresses that merged. The middle of them was like an endless hole.The room seemed clean but then unfortunately we found a boxer belongs to some previous customer.,2
excellent location little smaller rooms,7.9
- spacious rooms  - clean sheets  - Excellent view of the city from the 4th floor  - overall good experience :) - more comfy pillows  - no COVID rules for limiting the elevator use (Max 1 family),9
Location of hotel was excellent. Breakfast was also excellent. safe in bedroom was broken but as we didnt need it it made no difference to us.,8.8
The room was very clean and tidy weak wifi in the room but strong at the reception,9
Everything at this hotel was excellent. The hotel was very clean and comfortable the staff was excellent breakfast was great and it is in an excellent area within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. Will stay there again. No need for improvement. Everything was great.,10
the hotel was very easy to find at his location nice people that are working there very helpfull. especially t managment thank you for beeing so helpfull that day. the room was fabelous i stayed in 103 the terras was closely by so when the curtains are open and youre not dressed is that a little problem other then that it was an great experience to stay in the hotel,9
The beds were comfortable and the location was excellent Our room wasnt cleaned and was very basic,6.7
Great for sightseeing friendly efficient staff.  Would have liked timetable and coffee facilities in room ,8.8
The breakfast suited us very well although there was not much choice of hot cooked items.  The location was perfect. It was very central and not too far to walk from the train station. My only suggestion would be that they provide small teapots for the teabag as the little coffee cups were too small for tea drinkers.,7.9
Great location clean and comfy room No luggage room which could be a little insecure when leaving luggage before / after check out,7.1
Staff were very helpful in regards to places to eat and places to see One of the lights were out in our room there was a bad smell from the drains in the bathroom. The bed was very uncomfortable and made it hard to sleep,6.3
Perfect location to visit the City. Everything nearby Could be a little more clean.,7.5
Staff were lovely and very helpful Lights at the front of the building at night shone through curtains,6.7
It was very nice hotel with exellent location and helpful stuff. nothing,10
The location of the hotel was amazing close enough to main square but far enough away from the madness. Staff were lovely and beds were really comfortable!  Being on the 4th floor WiFi wasnt the best. ,9.2
 No minibar or a small fridge in the room,7.9
Staff ambiance position cleanliness decor shelving in rooms. Lighting in our room was low/poor.,8.3
Good location not far from the station. The room was clean and everything was working a good point :-). A goos location for the beginning of a city-trip. ,9
I really liked the location of the property. Its exactly where we wanted to be right near the buses and train station for daily trips out and also near to the square with shops and restaurants. I thought the rooms were incredibly nice for a 3 star and didnt expect as good as it actually was! The beds were comfy the bathrooms were clean with hand wash body and hair wash along with nice other additional things such as shower cap and shoe polish. There were a fair amount of plug sockets in the room which is always a handy and a fridge which Ive never found  in other hotels of 3 stars - at least back at home. The staff were very friendly always greeted us when leaving and entering throughout our stay and the WiFi was really good too.  ,9.2
Very comfortable bedsCentral locationGood restaurant in the hotel The room was not ready to check-in timeVery poor internet connection,8.8
Friendly staff great location and nice quirky hotel. The receptionist kindly gave us a map and told us about the places to visit and when to go. To followed her suggestions and we had a great time and got to see everything we wanted to. Its a bit tired and could do with a few things getting fixed.,8.8
The bath was super deep..  Perfect for relaxing after shopping. Nothing,7.9
Very charming hotel very well located beautiful views nice spacious room very friendly staff. The bathroom could use a make over it smelled musty and water seemed to be leaking on the floor. Also the television didnt have very good reception.,8
Right in the Center of Brugge lovely city It was a short stay checked out within a few hours for a meeting n didnt return would have loved to stay longer ,7
 The beds were uncomfortable. The room was a little bit cold.,6
Location was great. The restaurant beside was lovely and the man serving us was very nice. Bed was awful. Room had a step in the middle of it! Had to run shower for over 5 mins before getting hot water. Left door open at front door and manager shouted at us to close the door. Definitely not child friendly as steps everywhere in hotel.,3.8
The location of the hotel and the breakfast was very good. needs a little upgrading.,6.7
Great location near the city center  Cold temperature in the room. Little mould spots on the ceiling of the bathroom.,7.9
The location was brilliant the reception staff were very friendly. The hotel needed a little bit of money spending on it there was wall paper coming off from the walls and the bath was all scratched inside and needed resealing.,7.9
Close to the station and centrally located. In the middle of old town  which is great Unfortunately too noisy for me. The rooms and windows should be sound proof. I have no desire to listen to peoples amorous activities at 3 AM after coming home from the bar. The breakfast is also sub-standard for the amount you pay for it.,6
 They didnt give back the money from the key,7
Its was a nice place to stay No coffe or tea in room we loved it there but it would be nice if had coffee or tea in room  All in all nice clean place,7.5
One of the staff members Mat was real nice and understood my needs very well Everything was dated and needed a refresh,7.1
Good breakfast great location easy access to all the sights of Bruges.  Had a great time and the staff was quite helpful. ,10
Hotel undergoing painting and decorating ,7.9
Location Terrible smell in bathroom like raw sewage when I complained they sorted it no hot water when I complained I was told I have to leave shower running 15 minutes to get hot water!!!! Waited 15 minutes and still cold bed was 2 singles that kept slipping apart so very uncomfortable  loved bruge but hated this hotel and wasnt cheap 350 euro for 4 nights without breakfast  very angry..,3.8
Location from our sin Jan conference center A odor in the lift and lobby,10
Was cool! I will come back. Stuff was very friendly! ,9.6
The bed in our allocated room was excruciatingly uncomfortable. On our second attempt this was satisfactorily resolved Our first of two nights was really bad. We hardly slept because the bed was so uncomfortable. The breakfast was a disappointment. No ordinary plain tea black or green.,6
Location was excellent. Hotel was close to train station and two steps from the historic centre. Heating was good and room was spacious. Very uncomfortable matress leaning towards the middle. Filthy carpet and mouldy bathroom walls.,6.3
The hotels adjoining restaurant was excellent with friendly staff & a good choice of menu. Comfortable beds. ,9
Very nice room friendly and helpful staff ,9
The location the carpet was very dirty When I came in the night I meet the man who is working by the reception he was really NOT polite . ,4.2
Good location. Friendly staff. Comfortable beds. Bathroom very worn down. Breakfast for 12 Euro was a rip-off.,7.5
Good location nice and patient staff clean rooms. ,8.8
QualityFriendlinessAdapted to Covid psychose in best possible wayPrice / quality Covid restrictions but limited to a minimum,9
The location was good Very poor welcoming  Very cold room. The room also was located in a different building from where the actual hotel was  no access to the reception and if you needed anything they were hardly answered the phone .  ,4.6
Hotel was in great spot and stuff was so friendly. There was some problems with card paying.,8.3
The location was excellent and the staff were friendly and very helpful on our arrival. The mattresses were too soft and the heating in the room was not working properly we had to use the additional. Also after every shower we had the puddles in the bathroom the water was running alongside the glass and was going underneath. The sealing was not working properly. Moreover we missed some glasses to drink from and kettle to make a tea or coffee. Maybe more hangers would be better to have. We only had 3 in total for 2 people.,6.3
Room smelt damp got moved eventually. Breakfast wasent nice. Apple was rotten selection not good. Coffee not nice. Staff OK not overly helpful. Some staff nice some not so much.,4.6
Excellent location friendly people excellent value for money! Everything was according to my expectations,9
Bed was comfy and location was fab. No tea and coffee facilities. Quite loud.,5
Small but comfy and clean room—é Great location in quite area. Friendly staff. ,8.3
Location And amazing stuff At my first room there is no good wifi especialy at night but they changed to me,9.2
Location is nice next to fairly priced parking garage and walking distance to the entire city centre. The room itself was spacious and had three separate beds. Personell was friendly. Hygiene was bad. Fungus in the bathroom blower was clogged. Lot of dust on the towel heater. Several long hairs on the ground. Floor in the badroom should be replaced. Clearly no attention to details. Next to this there were lots of drunk people walking past the hotel at night I would recommend bringing earplugs. This is what could be expected from a 6.0 rated cheap hotel not a hotel with this price and rating.,5.8
The bed Room a bit damaged huge useless door ,5
Friendly staff comfortable and good breakfast Parking in the underground parking lot next to the hotel,8.8
Great value for money location size of the room. Free coffee in the lounge in the morning.  Nothing really just the bed was much too soft (not supportive) and no shower screen/curtain on the bath. ,7
Great staff they were extremely helpful in time of need knew the town inside out very patient respectful and cheerful. Also great location and has clean cute rooms. Lovely hotel but did not like the smell of the building and room.The bathtub was nice and big but if you like to shower you might not like the 4th floor as you cant stand in the tub due to slanting of the roof.,8.3
The position is amazing right in the center. I felt really welcome and the people that work there are really useful and nice. Super recommended! none,9
My room was comfortable clean and modern. The staff were friendly and the location was perfect. Excellent value for money ,10
Great location practicaly at the centre of Bruges parking garage just next to the hotel at reasonable price. Mattress was waaaay too soft.,8.8
friendly service+Very central really good location a bit noisy could hear neighbouring rooms-for some reason it was really hot in the room even though outside it was quite chilly-the bed was way too soft-the rooms and the hallway were quite run down                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I did not feel Very comfortable,7.1
The staff was very friendly and the beds were super comfy The view from our room was not that nice.,8.8
 the water in the shower was cold when the only thing i wanted to take a good bath and sleep. Also the bed was too soft that it was hard to move.,6
The location was excellent the breakfast was good and we were very glad that we could sit in chairs outside the room The beds were not good at all much too soft en the room was small,7.5
Very good location. 5mins walk from train station to the hotel and 10mins walk to the scenic spots. Staffs are nice and friendly. Toilet is very clean but a little bit smelly. I have to close the toilet cover before sleep.,8.8
The location of the hotel is ideal. Being in the outskirts of the centre of town means that its very easy to get around. Its a 10 minute walk from the train station and also 10 min away from the main tourist attractions. There are also plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes nearby. The staff members went out of their way to make my stay pleasant. The room was lovely and clean. The bed was so comfy that I snoozed my alarm 2 times in the morning before I finally got up. The building is showing its age - the facilities are a bit old but nonetheless clean and in a good state. My room was a bit chilly overnight but the duvet was very warm.,9.6
Good location. 15 min on foot from train station. Noise from the street. Floor cleaned rarely.,7.1
 Got a huge amount of bites (either mosquito or ant) all 3 nights I stayed in the room even though the doors and windows were closed ,7.9
The staff were lovely especially on the front desk- she was very informative and made us feel very welcome.   They also happily looked after our bags for us on our departure day which was great!   Fantastic location for exploring the beautiful city. The room was hot when we arrived but we were given a fan straight away when we asked.  The room was on the ground floor so we didnt feel that we could have the window open at night-  It was very clean.,8.3
Staff was very friendly informed us of the surrounding area mentioned the market in the square the next day. The hotel is perfect for a short stay in the city. ,9
Recepcionist was really kind he recommend us some restaurants to dinner and have lunch The room was cold I felt frozen and the heating was so weak,6.3
Everything was great! If you have a car this hotel is great for you. The parking is not expensive. The city has a big close parking area. Receptionists are very kind and helpful.  ,10
hotel is located close to the city center room wasnt very fancy but it was clean and fair enough. Bruges is magnificent so you will be out roaming most of the time anyway. the shower heads location in the bathtub is not very ideal sprays water out of the tub.,8
The beds were really comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Only negative was that the room was quite stuffy. The single ground floor window faced a street so couldnt open it enough to get decent air circulation without the noise getting too loud.,9.2
Hotel in the city centre.  Near the bus stations. ,7.5
Nice cosy hotel right in the centre. Ceilings are beautiful and made the room nice and airy. Shower was excellent bed super comfortable. ,10
Nice hotel located very comfortably in the old city and in the same time in the nearest to the train station zone.  The renovation is not so fresh,7.9
Location only nothing more. Staff was unfriendly and useless. Didnt help with luggage also asked for a kettle but they dont have any. Any requests they all said no. Such terrible service.,1
Great Location easy walk from the station and to the centre of Bruges. Good value for money and staff were very friendly. Good place to stay for a few days in beautiful Bruges.  ,9.6
Very good value for money. Quite close to the city center. Friendly staff. Comfy bed. Didnt find how to adjust the room temperature. It was either too cold in the evening or too hot at night.,8
This was my second time at this hotel. This time the room was better. The really short walking distance to the down town area and the train station is a big plus. I will book the hotel next time when Im in Brugge again. ,8.3
The coffee at breakfast The room was terrible dirty not value for money did complain but manager did not attempt to speak to us totally disgusted,2
Breakfast was great. So was location No shower only bath due to sloping roof,9.2
the room had a large bed and nice bathroom I dont know,8.8
Very nice hotel with a great location! Walking distance to the train station and to the main square of Brugge. We had a very nice balcony :) the only issue was that it doesnt have a lift for your luggage. ,9.2
 People doing very loud maintenance at 9 am outside our room. The bathroom was like a sauna as if the heater was on even though it was off. The matress is so soft that your back hurts. No toiletries provided,6.7
Nice bed. Super friendly staff. Well adapted for COVID (option to use dinning room) Cigarette smell in room. Room a bit small. Noise in the hallway early in the morning.,7
24h Checkin Small bed  Small room Not like the pictures,3
The location was good! The noise at the toilet,8
the room was clean and warm.  the location was good. we didnt eat or have anything to drink at the hotel but that was by choice. ,7.5
The hostess and localization because was so near the train station and the  downtown of brugge. the breakfast could have more varieties,10
Strategic location close to the city centre and to all the services clean and pleaseant room very nice and helpful staff great value for money. ,9
Great location close to the centre but not as busy. Staff were helpful. Hotel is right beside a bike rental place.  Our double bed was just two single mattresses pushed together and it wasnt very comfortable.,8.3
The cleaning was great Maybe the bed was too soft for me but is because I prefer them more firm.,9
The staff location and the bathroom was big and clean  Twin bed room for a single man! Very soft matress,8.3
 Lots of stuff broken sink didnt open power sockets were broken tiles in the bathroom were broken,5
Great location. Wonderful staff. Incredible price ,10
Position Beds badly fitted bed sheets. Rooms small with no outside light. Noise from toilets above our heads while trying to sleep. Towels old and past there best.,6.3
Location was very good. WiFi did not work well tub dangerous to climb in and out of for shower - grab bar but in ridiculous place toilet paper holder broken and paper just jammed in between two sharp metal pieces. Would not choose to stay there again. ,6.7
Great location< both for the old town and getting to and from the rail station and service. Helpful staff. Just overall a very pleasant stay. ,10
The position was excellent.The staff were very friendly and welcoming.The restaurant next door offered a very reasonable tourist meal. The waiter Serge and his brother Cedric were very attentive and welcoming also!  The rooms were very hot. Doonas were a bit stained,7.9
Good location in old town and above underground car park. Good eating and drinking options nearby. Bathroom very poor bath was under a sloping ceiling which means that the shower hose is unusable as you cannot stand and the water pressure is so low that it would take forever to fill the bath.,7.5
The location was next to the large underground car park so a positive. Staff nice and friendly. Room small but adequate. Breakfast was good a selection of cheeses ham boiled eggs and typical continental type food. Even had a fresh orange crushing machine !! Lots of tea and coffee. We only stayed one night so the hotel was just right. The mattress was really soft and bouncy (too soft really) which is just a minor point.,8.3
Central to everything. Restaurant meals and breakfasts great. ,8.3
Nice greeting from helpful member of staff. Staff member very rude. No room service when requested a coffee. Told not allowed as new carpet in room. But we had wood floor in our very shabby room. Wont be returning.,6.3
I dont even know where to start the hotel is located in a very good area. The stuff was very friendly. The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. The town itself is very small and everything is in a walking distance. Me and my mom loved the stay in Bruges! ,10
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is great kind of in the middle of everything you want to visit.  ,10
Excellent location and staff! Rooms had a strange stink - probably because it remained shut for a long time because of covid.,7
We did not take in the breakfast at your Hotel. Sorry! ,10
Very good location friendly and helpful staff.  5 mins from the centre of Bruges and 10 mins walk from the station.  Clean and warm. We had booked a twin room but it was made up as a double - when we split the beds there was very little room for manoeuvre!  The tap on the sink was loose and the arm on the chair by the desk was hanging off.,6
Staff are nice. Heater system is amazing. The room are equipped very clean and quiet. There are a few steps (after elevator) which is hard for carrying big luggage. Some problems with drainage of the sink,9.2
The  room was very comfortable. Tea making facilities in the room would be nice.,8.8
The stuff were friendly.  The stuff were helpful. the payment conditions were fantastic.  beacause there was no visa needed nor prepayment. location is very good. the mattress was loosing only on last day  however everything else was quite okay.,10
Locomotion was great! Room 106 was the stinkiest room I have ever had. Ive stayed and places in Thailand and Cambodia.‚òπÔ∏è,6.7
Spacious room close to old city and parking/station excellent breakfast. ,9
Service was very kind and professional We got the worst room - something that almost always happens when we book on Booking.com,8
1- Location very closed to the Belle Epoque district 2-Hotel itself and its Staff and facilities Absolutely nothing,9
Quite and staff is very good Bed is so soft,8
The location of the hotel was excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The family room was great very open and a lot of space. The breakfast was just unbelievable everything was just delicious. This hotel is A MUST. There was nothing to not like.,10
The spacious room and the young receptionist that checked us in was super nice. I thought we would have a bath tub in the room but we had a shower. Also the wellness spa area was small in my opinion. The pool was a little cold too,8
Quiet Comfy friendly really helpful staff even when we had to move our check in to 02:00.! And our breakfast box ... wow fantastic. Will definitely stay here again when we work this direction. Thank you Richard ,10
This place exceeded all expectations. Great value for money. Booked it to visited Bruge and it was the best decision. ,10
Functional - ideal for what we were after. Breakfast was amazing and worth a special mention. Wi-fi connectivity in the room was poor. One member of staff at reception far less friendly from all the others which were great,8.8
great location: exactly between the Blankenberge Beach and the train station a small but neatly arranged room good quality and varied breakfast buffet I could not understand why they did not have enough keys for the garage - we had to return ours every time we used it.,8
Excellent breakfast nice swimming pool close to the beach ,9
Very good breakfast swimming pool and wellness center. The room was comfortable and quite. The staff friendly. ,9
The hotel is in a fantastic area almost on the beach. The pool area and pool itself was great also well adjusted to covid restrictions. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was delivered to the room and it was really abundant. However the biggest treasure of our stay was Mo the guest manager. Smile helpfulness patience explaining things - he has it all. Mo is the best said my 9 yrs old daughter and asked me to come back to this hotel. We definetely will. ,9
Excellent location really easy to find. The Hotel staff was wonderful very helpful and concerned with the best way to please us. Swimming pool was open we were able to enjoy it but unfortunately the SPA closed due the actual COVID situation. Breakfast follow the same principle the staff was always on top of us nothing missed. Was not a buffet again due the restrictions but all we asked for was provided accordingly. We were impressed with the care of all. Only remark will be with regards to the parking that limits the distance and time me as tourist can park and walk to the hotel. The big car park is 10m walking to the hotel with luggage and rain is not very pleaseant,9
We booked a weekend away to the coast in Belgium an found this hotel in Blankenberg by coincidence.The reviews of this hotel caught my attention aswell the value for money. We did not hesitate to make a reservation and we absolutely do not regret it. It was the perfect choice.The hotel itself including the facilities the rooms and the staff are outstanding and they do their job really professional and always welcoming for any questions you have. Always a smile on their face they made us feel so welcoming.My wife and I we can only recommend this property and we will definitely come back to it.Moreover the breakfast in the morning is an absolute beauty!! Outstanding and really attentive staff!! :)Recommend by 2 happy weekenders from Luxembourg. Nothing to report.,10
Surprisingly spacious single room. Friendly and helpful staff with sense of humor. Good connection to Brussels International Airport (Zaventem) both by car and by direct bus. Tasty food in the restaurant especially the chicken. Big private parking. The restaurant is closed on Friday evening but there are good places to eat nearby.,9.2
Lovely looking hotel location fairly close to City Centre and Expo Brussels good breakfast plenty of parking late check-in possible. Interior of hotel does not match the exterior could do with an update inside. Staff were friendly enough but not overly forthcoming with any information i.e. breakfast times location of rooms and lift WiFi. Room was a little expensive for what was on offer. WiFi connection was poor in the room morning shower was cold.,7
Good location super BIG rooms and a nice buffet breakfast and good nespresso coffee Zero,7.9
Excellent and friendly service  very good breakfast Rooms a bit old and dated,7.5
Nothing at all Everything staff was not helping at all.Breakfast is very poor and room was so bad even a crack in the wall was therePrice is very high compared to the quality of the rooms,2.5
Good restaurant comfortable bed good breakfast. ,3.3
Excellent breakfast with fresh products. Variety of salty and sweet. Staff was correct but not extreem friendly which I expect for this price.,6.7
So expensive. Small room (not the same as the pictures). Good location next to the main station. ,4.2
Perfect location for the station and Art Gallery. A very regular tram to take you into the centre of the  city.  A beautiful train station too !! ,9
The personnel is really good and friendly! They are ready to help in any situation.The room was quite big. The noise from railway was practically not heard. In case you need to stay somewhere close to city center for a reasonable price - its a very good option! The noise from telephone in hall in the morning.,7.5
Close to the old town. Free parking Breakfast was a bit simple.,7.1
We were happy to be able to take a walk along the river into Ghent. ,9
Breakfast was good the hotel has a really good quiet location. The staff were very nice and helpful to us! The room was clean the beds were comfortable. Parking can be a little bit of an issue especially if you have a big car. But there are other very cheap parking options close by the staff was very helpful about this.,8
Very nice staff at reception. Comfortable and well-furnished room. What is always important is a clean and spacious bathroom. Typical Belgian breakfast. It could be a bit more varied. Besides I have no remarks.,7.9
Nice hotel closed to Gent St Peters station.its good if you are thinking travel to other cities too. No noises and clean rooms Little rooms. Dark zone . Its away from the downtown its necessary take the tram or a bus.,7.1
We bought the hotel on its location to the railway station and it met all our expectations. Nothing,8.8
Clean and comfortable well presented decor. WiFi didnt work. We told them we didnt want breakfast but they still called our room to ask 15 minutes before service finished. Parking was free for cars but our short wheel base VW T5 van wouldnt fit so had to park on the street.,6.7
Great location. Friendly staff. Bit limited on facilities for 3/4 star hotel. ,7.1
Rooms were great The pillows could have been better but the room in general for exceeded pur expectations. Very nice hotel. Would reccomend and would stay again,8.8
The location First time ever that I stayed in hotel where they did not have shampoo and soap available.,6.7
Large rooms clean and very spacious. Beds were very confortable & welcoming staff.  Location is very (too?) close from the nearby railways - sound proofing could be improved.,6.7
Quick efficient checkin. Good value for money paid. Great room. Very close to St Pieters train station. ,10
Proximity with train station Warm welcome Good bed quality Breakfast only starting from 7.00am where most of hotels start at least at 6.30,7
Bed was okay happy with two extra pillows as standard  and there was a nice bath.  Breakfast only starts at 8am no arcondition in the room,7.1
 I was very surprised there wasnt any coffee/tea available Im out room,6
Very good location close to the train station and a reasonable walking distance to the centre of Ghent. Also very nice staff and a overall cozy atmosphere. ,9.2
Great facilities comfortable bed great staff! Totally recommend! ,9.2
The beds and the bath are good Parking is way too small. Easy to hear noise from railway station.,7
friendly staff - great breakfast - great location fairly expensive for the level of comfort -  very unpractical shower,7.5
We loved our stay here. We travelled by car so it was very easy to reach the city of Maastricht and the outlet village in Maasmechelen as well. The hotel itself is just lovely its a very unique building which we loved. The staff is just friendly and id give 12 out of 10 points for them! The restaurant inside was lovely too.  Our room was nice and clean parkingspots provided. just highly recommended well deffo come back here! We actually dont have any negative points to be honest. We just loved it!,9.6
The property is built under a mill whys not to like?! Its a new decor kinda place and the room layout is funky stylish and very modern. I only got a glimpse of the restaurant (closed due to covid) but it looked great and would definitely be an place I would revisit if I was in the area. The Owner is awesome and stayed up till 22:00 awaiting our arrival LEGEND! All in all this place has everything and looks great for a couple nights stay and its very easy to find (just look for the massive mill and youll be fine )  I loved it all.,10
Well decorated rooms good size. Restaurant not open at night.  No tea or coffee making facilities in room. This is supposed to be a 4* hotel.  It isnt.  Say 3+. The rooms are very nice but when youve been working and driving all day the last thing you need is to go hunting for somewhere to eat.  My dinner was a packet of biscuits.  And tap water.  Great.  4* ?  I stayed a Mercure last night and that was a 4* great meal good room etc.,6.7
 Airconditioning wasnt really cold enough in 30C heat.,7.1
Very nice hotel very nice owners! Restaurant with peefect food! Thank you so much for your hospitality! ,10
Staff were excellent helpful aand friendly food was divine and Bernado made us feel as if we were part of the family highly recommended ,9.2
Staff at the reception was kind to us. Bathroom could be better. Amd the pillows are too much soft. but it worth the stay in this hotel. ,7.5
Almost nothing Very bad hotel safety and hygiene are the least of their concerns and overall badly maintained - The closet fell down and i almost hit my head - The tap is broken - Dirts are everywhere on the wall door wc etc .. - TV is not working (But it was the least concern ..) - You need to wait 15 minutes for the water to become warm - WC and shower are directly in the room no real separation - Water leaks from the shower to the room - The neighborhood area around didnt seem safe See attached photos from inside so you know what to expect I complained the first night about the closet and the tap but they didnt care much I stayed 2 nights and i am really glad to leave this place. I absolutely dont recommend this hotel,3.3
I really enjoyed breakfast. It surprised me. There were delicious croissants cheese ham bread boiled egg. Very tasty coffee and chocolate drink. The location is very convenient - close to sights and to main transport. It was what I was already expected from reviews of others - the hotel equipment and furniture are old (but room and bathroom was clean). Corridors and stairs could have been cleaner.,7.5
Price location staff There is room for improvement regarding the furniture and walls aspects.,8.8
Very friendly and willing to help staff without asking for help. They helped to climb up the stairs my lagguage as there is no elevator. Must have renovation of rooms and furniture as  it without doors and out of order. The impression is depressing.,6.3
Ideal for a single/two night stay. The stuff are friendly and are speaking English fluently. They even offered me some complimentary water from the breakfast fountain. The area is a bit dodgy. Went out to get some supplies from a corner shop. Apparently the place is close to `places` so dodgy characters are about. The corner shop bossman advised me not to walk around.,6.7
Hotel was clean. and staff was also friendly. Hotel was ok but the bad thing was that no lift in the hotel and we stayed at third floor. with all luggage you have to go through stairs and no fan and ac and the weather was so hot.,6.7
Near to the station and 15 min walking time to the center Small corridors and stairs.. need more light,7.5
the. bed was ok no lift no aircon and no help from the staff to move the bags to the room. the room was not completely clean.,4.6
Nothing The worst hotel in Brussels. Smelling very bad. Bath has no door splashing water everywhere. Toilet was not clean. Horrible place,3.8
Frendly and helpful stafflocationprice Viewstairsshower cabin was broken,8.8
The hotel is close to the north train station and cheap by Brussels standards. The room is very small and there was no hot water.,5.8
I loved the location it is close to the train station and flixbus station.Good area.Facilities were good. Bright room and with large windows it was a bit hot so opening the windows gave a fresh air sensation the breeze was so good.Hot shower and good beds. Felt comfortable.The staff were all welcoming and patient as I had to wait for at least 4 hours to check in they allowed me to stay there in the sofa and wait until my room was ready. Also allowed me to check in earlier than expected. Nothing.,10
Staff was really helpful. They have open bath seat inside the room. When you use it smell spread in whole room which is really bad. Bathroom and living room shouldnt be the same room. In pictures they showed the separate bathroom. ,6.3
The sheets were washed and staff had cleaned room and staff were friendly. Water stains and damp on the walls mould on all the grouting in the bathroom. The matresses and curtains  were very dirty and window sill was loose. Door broken on shower replaced with inadequate shower curtain and the shower head was broken. Walls are very thin and we could hear the next door party and downstairs guests. Stair case was incredibly narrow and a big suitcase would not have fitted. There were also very dodgy electric sockets. DO NOT RECOMMEND.,5
Staff behaviour was good and they were quite helpful. Room was value for money. No lift. Staircase is quite narrow with small steps. Room door lock was not functioning properly.,9.2
Staff was very kind and the room was quiet and comfortable. Price was perhaps a little high considering the location.,6.7
Good location Very dirty and stinky room. The door was broken the heating was broken. Everything smelled like cigarette it was really disapointing..,4.6
The location Warm. No air ventilation in the rooms. No fan nor aircond. ,4.6
Good location staff and price. It was really cold in room at night.,7.5
Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast and Wifi not working.,7.1
This is a great hotel - the host was very welcoming knowledgeable and a great cook. The location cannot be beat - quiet but very close to everything. Beds were comfortable and everything was clean. ,8.8
We were pleasantly surprised at the excellent facilities afforded to us as we only booked the day before. Full marks for a great stay. Thank you Vincent. So convenient for taking in the sights. Cant think of a thing !,10
comfortable room with friendly staff who were coping well with the new Covid regulations. breakfast had to be pre ordered (no problems) with a choice of continental or cooked. all was good,9
Excellent location staff and value definitely stay at the hotel Ambrosia again. Nothing bad about the hotel. Stayed in the small single room small but big enough.,10
The people that own the hotel are lovely people. location couldnt be better #lovebelguim Nothing,10
Great breakfast selection. Great finishing touches to room. Good parking No issues,10
Terrific location just a few hundred yards from the main square. Our hosts were welcoming and helpful with plenty of additional information available about the local area. A very nice breakfast to set you up for the day. We were on the second floor and the steps up were quite steep!  The room is built into the loft space and is a little cramped for a couple.,8.8
Breakfast was excellent a big choice including an English breakfast only a very short walk to the centre Tea making facilities in the room,10
Close to the Centre Friendly helpful staff. ,8.8
Very friendly and helpful ownersthey knew everything about anything.Breakfast really fresh produce and cooked to order.Rooms very clean . We were on the top floor and kept banging our heads on the sloping roof.The hotel was full so no other room available. No tea and coffee in rooms but available in reception until 10 pm. Take insect repellent the mosquitoes are vicious.,8.5
Excellent breakfast continental plus toast bacon and eggs available. Quite location but close to the centre. Very friendly and helpful owners and staff. Not a lot.,10
Staff were fantastic so was the location ,9.6
Great little hotel right in the heart of town. Owner was very friendly with lots of local information. Very relaxed stay and great breakfast Nothing,10
Owners were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was good Pillows lumpy,7.9
Great location lovely staff excellent breakfast  ,10
Superb location in the centre with parking opposite the reception. The owners advised that we could park in free carpark nearby but we chose to leave it next to the hotel. The owner offered to feed the meter for us while we were sightseeing. The parking was free from 6pm til 9am the next morning. Comfortable room with an excellent breakfast. Nothing was too much trouble..we hope to return. Nothing,10
Excellent..helpful and friendly service  peaceful comfortable good breakfast and I would return. Nothing.,10
Location comfortable helpful & friendly staff & good breakfast. Definitely come back. Nothing,10
Nice breakfast bacon eggs and toast and also a buffet. Very good coffee. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak excellent English. There is no lift but the staff will happily help you with your luggage if necessary. ,9.6
This is charming hotel efficiently and skillfully run in the quietest street off the grand place.  Parking outside on a Sunday was easy.  The owner is very careing and is very guest orintated.  Room is on the ground floor and helpful for our accumulated luggage.  A good place to stay to vist the town and the surrounding WW1 places of interest.  All very straightforwrad and hassle free. ,9.2
Excellent the owners react you very well and cannot do enough for youI almost did not want to praise them to much as it might make it difficult for us to return because it would always be fully booked Nothing,10
I liked how helpful the staff was with things to see and do we thought all of their recommendations were spot-on. ,10
The hotel team are great answering every question and nice and polite at all times.  The rooms were spacious with netting to keep out the flies and good curtains to keep out the light.  Love the honest box for the coffee in reception happily pay for good coffee Breakfast was good and included in the price.  The silly thing is I assumed the eggs would be scrambled and they came out fried.  Delicious but I should have clarified what eggs I would like.,9
 Loads of great information and hotel perfectly placed,10
very friendly welcome - immaculate room - such a comfortable bed - brilliant location just off the main square - cooked breakfast absolutely delicious - lovely staff nothing,10

The location was superb in a quiet area in the centre of town. Breakfast was good and the staff without exception cheerful and helpful. Recommended ,10

Nice clean hotel in a great central location withvery helpful friendly staff/owners. ,9.6
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good. The location was excellent. The bed was very comfortable. I would have liked to have tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom but they were available for guests to help themselves to on the ground floor.,9.6
Fantastic family run facility with Vincent and Iwona being great to deal with. Thanks again to Vincent for taking me to pick up the rental car when the car company advised they could not deliver as promised. Need to also mention Pebbles who was always bright and bubbly and very helpful as well. Would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel to anyone intending to visit Ieper. Nothing,10

Stayed at this lovely bnb for a weekend getaway and to also explore the WWI sites. Everything was lovely - the bed is super comfy the staff very friendly and the breakfast excellent! It is right near the center of town so just an easy walk to everything. There are also bikes for rent so I took one out and the bike was also excellent. Nothing to complain about,10
Position and cleanliness. Staff friendly and helpful. ,10
Friendly host. Great breakfast. Perfect location. ,10
Nice hotel in convenient location for exploring Ypres. Can walk to many bars restaurants sights etc. Very friendly and helpful owners gave good advice for sight-seeing. Simple breakfast due to current restrictions. Very nice and clean room with comfortable beds. On-street parking right outside hotel. A fan should be provided in the rooms in the hot summer.,8
Breakfast was excellent. No fridge in the room for storing food or drink.  Room was small and cramped.  No lift for carrying bags upstairs.  No ironing facilities.  On street parking was found but may be difficult in busy times.,7.9
Breakfast was excellent English and Continental choice with pleasant staff. Steep stairs! I was on the 2nd floor.,9
The welcome from the owners. Pebbles at breakfast!! Lovely breakfast ,10
Hotel Ambrosia was perfect for our purposes. Its very close to the centre of Ypres the room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was very tasty too. The couple that run the hotel are very friendly and helpful. Nothing negative to say really,10
Central location. Extremely friendly owner Iwona who was most helpful. Only criticism was that the room was on the small side. However all in all an lovely hotel to stay in. See above,9.6
Despite the current situation and the rules in places complicating things the staff was friendly and made our stay comfortable. The location is great right in center. ,8
Spacious room Fried eggs were perfect Coffee available all day Cycle hire available Nothing,9.6
Staff were so accommodating.  Breakfast made to order superb. No AC so had to leave windows open. Road noise made for difficult sleep.  Street parking can be tricky but it worked out.,7.5
Vincent & his wife were good people who knew  The area & the battlefield s & his wife could make perfect fried eggs. Nothing its a great place to stay .,10
Simple well cooked breakfast pleasant staff comfy clean rooms near to Ypres centre Had to park quite a distance away but wasnt that inconvenient,7.9

Friendly owners good location good value. Nothing all good.,9.6
Friendly staff and atmosphere.  Good breakfast. Our room was just a little dark but this doesnt affect my overall positive impression.,9.6
Very clean hotel. Close to the centre of yreps Great breakfast  ,10
Breakfast was good area is very quiet.  Our room faced the back so we never heard the trains across the street even with the window open. Area around Gent-St Pieters is very quiet but we enjoyed walking about town.  Trams stop around the corner and also in front of station.  Walk at least one way into the town to take in the shops.,9.5
Lovely hotel helpful staff with check in. Nice facilities - everything is quite new The location is a little out of the main town although only a few minutes from the station.,8.8
Very friendly and helpful staff Exceptional breakfast Outside the new Low Emissions Zone with easy on site parking- so very car friendly. But also a five minute walk from the main station  ,9.6
Closely located to Gent train station. Very comfortable bed and clean room. Train tracks on the other side of the road sometimes a bit of an irritation.,9.6
Vicinity to train station Attention to details Staff ,10
Great bed a lot of space in the room and bathroom free parking right on premises snack bar 24/7 and free water in the room. The breakfast area is very pretty especially when the weather permits the terrace space and the breakfast itself is very good. Above all the staff was very friendly.  The room setup was a bit strange with a double door the separation of bathroom and room not ideal and some equipment not of great style.,9
Very friendly staff good parking possibilities very clean rooms. And as a little bonus surprise the mini bar was free :) We knew that before so it is not really a dislike but the property is relatively far away from the city center. If you want to walk it will take about 30 minutes.,8
friendly helpful spotless very tasty breakfast everything delicious and fresh it is a bit noisy especially in hot weather though they do provide ear plugs,7.9
Although the hotel is next to the train track we could hardly hear the train. Good soundproofing. We were surprised that they provided 5 complimentary bottles of drinks every day. - Coke lemonade beers and 2 water. :) Friendly and helpful staff Best of the 5 hotels I stayed in this trip ! WiFi connection was weak. Could only connect when I am nearer the corridor.,10
Great location for the station. Lovely area to stroll around. Quiet location noise from the trains nearby was inaudible if windows closed but not if windows open. However trains didnt run through the night so no real problem. Helpful host offered advice for eating out and sight seeing. It would be great to have a lounge area to sit for a coffee or drink apart from the breakfast room.,9.2
Just Standard Items on the breakfast Small pieces but also Handmade Stuff. ,9.2
Very kind stuff. You could have more variety on breakfast.,9.2
Breakfast was excellent! Noise of railway,7.5
All round very good. The room was well decorated comfortable and spotlessly clean (the bathroom in particular was immaculate) and had a little kettle with tea and coffee. You dont get this in France so we were especially pleased to see that you do in Gent! The hotel is well-situated for the Art Museum and the city centre is a manageable half-hour walk away. Car parking is paying but with lots of room for any size of car. Finally the Northern European style breakfast was excellent with a fantastic selection of cheese sausage different kinds of bread viennoiseries teas and so on. All in all a delightful stay which ended too soon. I cant see room for improvement.,10
Great location with plenty of parking - just outside the congestion zone.Also inclusive mini-bar was very welcome thank you!!  ,10
friendly staff nice breakfast price  is enormous location near station not that interesting as Dampoort   is nearer the centre and nearer  Holland as well,8
Relaxed private vibe spacious quiet  room with a garden view surprise bath with jacuzzi for no extra costs slightly (5 min) further than other hotels but much better quality. I really enjoyed my stay. ,8.3
Very easy check-in (nobody at reception but instructions were given via email and were very clear). The room was very clean beautiful bathroom with rituals soap. The new windows blocked out the noise of  the trains. Thanks to the foodcorner we had a very nice dinner (Lasagna and ice cream) and breakfast in the room was also very good (large choice available).Would love to go again :) Nothing,9
Super friendly hotel very good breakfast nice and clean rooms amazing bathroom. Would definitely recommend!  ,10
We got a bigger room than we had expected. Everything was really fine the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. They even let us leave our luggage in the reception after check-out. Everybody was very friendly. Considering the fact that we came to Gent in February the prices could have been a little lower. But in the end it was worth it Belgium is a very beautiful country (especially Gent and Bruges).  We would have appreciated an earlier check-in but it was not possible.,9.6
Rooms were clean and a good standard- particularly the bathroom which looked recently renovated. Breakfast was fantastic and very good value for money. The only downside to my stay was the lack of sound insulation from TV noise coming from adjacent rooms. I could almost hear the words spoken on whatever programme was on.,9.2
Room was extremely spacious spa-bath and bed were both extremely comfy after a long day of exploring Ghent. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of offerings for the price. Staff was extremely friendly and provided plenty of information and notes on the city. Hotel itself is a fair walk from the city center but only a few minutes from the train station and other public transport options. Room was a little cold and interior lighting was rather dim. By contrast being on the first floor facing out bright exterior spotlights shined into the windows all night. Blackout curtains are provided though this also blacks out the morning light for those who like to wake up to it it can be a bit irksome. Train also runs directly in front of the building so occasionally a little noisy.,9.2
nice place quiet with small terrace was exactly what we needed small cleaning issues in cupboard you could see someone didnt clean for a while. one small issue lack of toilet paper( funny but we received the room with last  pieces. could be nice to have another roll on the side.,8
The braekfast was excellent The construction noise and the small size of the room were the only points that were less positive.,10
Staff were excellent rooms very clean and breakfast was amazing! Would recommend and definitely stay again. Nothing.,10
Super nice breakfast keep it up. Thank you.  ,10
We loved the fact that it was really clean everything was out of perfection. Comfortable bed beautiful badroom and very clean nice lightning in the room. and close to the station from Gent (Sint-Pieters).  I dont have many bad things to say about the hotel but the only thing me and my husband didnt like was the smokers room. And I say room because in fact it was outside without anything to cover it. it was not protected from raining cold. nothing.Also the guarantee that the hotel takes from your credit card is really awkward. Ive booked many times in different countries from Europe via booking.com and I never had to pay a guarantee before arriving at the hotel.. ,9.6
Most helpful and welcoming staff. Wonderful breakfast (yummy jams). Very nice spacious room and bathroom (huge shower). Massive bed with a Tempur-like like topper. Lovely little garden. Very quiet. The mattress can feel very soft to some. I normally dont like soft mattresses but I slept like a baby on that one.  Beware that the hotel is close to a train station (earplugs provided) but otherwise very quiet.,9.6
Extremely well organised for covid with frozen meals in fridges microwaves . Really impressive. Loved the jacuzzi bath too ! The breakfast was good of course but why everything in mini 1x mini pain au chocolat 1x mini bun. Would be good to have a normal sized portion for the prize of the breakfast.Having the mini bar next to my pillow prevented me from falling asleep easily as it gets noisy when it starts up,9
Everything was excellent thank you everybody I will definitivelly come back ,10
Recently refurbished rooms done to a really high standard.  The staff were very friendly and talked us through how to get around Ghent and offered bike rental at the hotel.  The breakfast options were tasty. There was noisy refurbishment happening in several rooms and the workers started at around 8am which felt a bit early given we were on holiday.  The breakfast options werent that plentiful we had to ask for more stuff several times.,9
I really appreciated the different dinner alternatives once got to the hotel. It was not supposed to be but in this covid time they set up a small food court. ,10
The breakfast was delicious and good price. Staff were lovely hotel was very clean. Great stay in a fantastic hotel and city ,10
Covid-preparedness was very good. Frozen meals for dinner is a very good idea when restaurants are getting closed. ,9
Exceptional service and excellent facilities! Super cute rooms and good quality breakfast. Loved that you could hire bikes easily for the day for a reasonable price! ,9.6
Breakfast was excellent. Location fairly close to Gent-St Pieters station was ideal. View from my window of the railway s a railway fan was excellent. Info provided by reception regarding the beautiful city and getting to the football ground was excellent. Would stay there again if I return to Gent. And there were tea and coffee making facilities in the room not a given in continental Europe. Nothing,10
The staff were exceptional making our stay eas and comfortable. ,10
Everything but especially home-made diner in self-service to be eaten in your room (Covid-19) and nice breakfast a la carte ordered by Internet. ,10
Very clean comfortable & cousyVery good breakfast!! Staff very friendly!! Would definitely come back ,8.3
Small but cute room with a bathroom with whirlpool. Very nice and polite staff! It was too dark in the room old wooden floors.,8
Clean bath with jacuzzi friendly staff  Windows not opening- room smaller than what expected for deluxe room and from pics,9.2
Really friendly and helpful staff super excellent breakfast in a lovely setting (home made-made jams granola yoghurt etc.) with good coffee brewed by the cup everything I needed/wanted in my room easy walk from train station. I loved this place. -,10
The central location and the friendly helpful staff. The restaurant area was somewhat cramped. An updated interior would be beneficial.,8.3
Friendlly staff helped us with the language barrier English descriiptions on menu,9.6
location - good room comparitively expensive considering locatoin,7.1
So clean - nice Staff- good value - excellent breakfast included - will go again next year Nothing,10
good breakfast clean room and friendly staff the space in the room is too small for two people,8.3
Room comfy and a good shower Attitude of the owner,6.3
The staff are excellent as is the food The bathroom was tired and needing updating,9.6
Friendly staff spacious rooms good accessibility. ,8.3
Nice light and airy corner room recently refurbished in tasteful modern style. Friendly terrace/bar obviously well supported by local population. Good selection food/beers etc. Helpful/efficient staff Be prepared the hotel is on a main road although it doesnt look like it heavy traffic a bit noisy at night but you soon get used to it.,9.6
 WiFi signal is very weak can hardly get connected. But staffs did nothing and even no answer to my email about the WiFi problem if like this I think they should not say they have WiFi.And the room rate should be recalculated. And the staff is not so friendly while I was asking for a wine opener. I can not understand that a restaurant have no wine opener!,5
Friendly and accommodating staff. Lovely place perfect for purpose of our stay and plenty of rooms for our group. ,8.3
Continental breakfast was very good  Rooms clean and tidy.  Location was excellent for what we wanted. Most of the staff were excellent.  Restaurant was very popular There was four of us and we had booked a three bedroom apartment but was told this was not available on arrival. We were given two double rooms which impacted on our stay as we had to share rooms. The hotel blamed booking.com but we doubt this was correct. If the hotel can not provide the accommodation booked they should not be listing on booking.com. We did not feel over welcomed. The reception area is the same area as the restaurant counter area which is strange.,7.5
Good value over all. Excellent location. Not applicable,9
basic bread rolls and cheeses meats and jams .no cooked breakfast option breakfast,9
We got a huge room facing the canal very quiet and bright and very well equiped  Staff was very friendly providing information on the city sightseing as well as the take away menu from several restaurants nearby the breakfast served in the room was delicious as well ,9
Location was excellent very comfortable and good value for money.The staff was amazing and very helpful. ,10
Fancy Great view Good breakfast Very nice staff  Nothing,9
Clean modern fresh There were some renovations ongoing. But hey that needs to be done sometimes. ,9
 What a lovely hotel! Newly renovated very clean beautiful views. The breakfast was amazing fresh juice warm crossionts and bread and extremely covid safe without feeling like it. Outstanding hospitality by all staff I couldnt recommend this more.,10
Really nice getaway even in Corona times. Great breakfast in the room - in the historical center nicely decorated. We really enjoyed our stay. ,10
Very nice hotel completely renovated with a very tasteful interior. My room and bathroom were brand-new and very clean. Breakfast was extensive everything was fresh and tasteful. Location is in the centre of Bruges quiet area with spectacular views.  The owners and staff were very friendly and helpful. Will definitely return! Nothing,10
The bed and sheets The serviceThe breakfastFriday evening drinks in the courtyardThe location Lights above the wash hand bassinand the door to the bathroom was pretty tougher open ,10
Very good locationClean The hotel felt more like a hostel.The room was small and cramped,6
great breakfast served at your table drinks and bites at arrival. Was a nice welcome! Very friendly staff. ,9
Nice breakfast. Nice hotel for young people. Locatie perfect. Very attentive personnel The room was very small. We are an older couple and were bumping into everything all the time. Beds were not too comfortable.,7.9
Right in the heart of the city with plenty of restaurants to hand. Staff very friendly and rooms clean and modern. It says breakfast included but this was a fixed breakfast with no allowance for dietary requirements or likes and dislikes.,9.2
I loved everything from the luminous entrance with all cristals around to the decoration the artistic atmosphere and style of the the enviroment to the excellent service very kind to the very good breakfast and the cossy rooms..we will stay again for sure¬° the best hotel in Antwerp¬°¬°¬°¬° ,10
Close to the groeiplaats and grote markt van Antwerpen. Friendly staff and perfect breakfast. The climate in the room. Heating is poor. You need to heat the entire room to take a shower and than it is too warm to sleep too cold and noisy to leave the window open.. hallway is very noisy not well isolated ,8.3
The hotel was in a great location and I have to give it to the terrific staff very friendly and very helpful. Was pleasure dealing with them throughout the entire stay. However value for money was not there for me. I stayed with my colleagues for business the first night and with my partner for the second night. For a work event there is no issue as the location is most important. For a personal get away I found the room no good value for money. The rooms are far too minimalistic for the amount of money we paid per night. I would not have paid more than 75EUR for that room (we paid <100EUR),6
Great friendly staff. The complimentary snacks and drinks ,10
very friendly ladies at reception who gave us a nice glass of cava before we entered the room. also for hotel guests you have a free open bar until 20h with lots of snacks and drinks! the room was not too big but all you need and a very comfortable bed. I did not hear any noise from outside so thats always good especially given you are in the center of the city! would definitely book again ,9
Central location friendly staff very tasty breakfast Beds way to to soft for my taste,7.9
Nothing! 24/7 means open all times not the case here they shut the front door around 8:30pm and its a nightmare to check in after! Not all the rooms have air conditioning thats a bit of a joke. No celling light in the bedroom leaves the rooms pretty dark. Breakfast a rip off. Best avoid,2.9
Location The smallest room i have ever stayed at (35 years of busniess travel).,5
The room was just right - clean and comfortable.  The complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening were an unexpected bonus Noise from the room upstairs but not the hotels fault - just inconsiderate guests!,7.1
The staff were really helpful. The location is great close to so much and easy to find. The breakfast and service was great too. Our room was lovely and the bed very comfy. I would definitely stay again. I was a little disappointed that they stocked the bedroom with water bottles rather than just having tap water. It was also a shame that there was no mimi fridge in the room but with drinks provided downstairs it wasnt too much of a problem.,7.5
Great location and super comfy beds One shower gel for two :(,9.2
Clean rooms excellent breakfast complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening helpful and polite staff. The room was a little tired.,9
Excellent location. The deluxe rooms offer a bathtub worth the small extra. ,10
good location / cosy lobby Rooms are clean but they feel less than basic / wifi didnt work / the heating was not sufficiently strong to heat up the room it was cold. I paid 180 EUR for a night .. for this price I could book a 5-star in the same street,5.8
location booked a room which  stated it was tiny there was no room to walk around the bed dont think this should be advertised as a double room more of a single. The only upgrade was the junior suite which was ¬£120 more for the two nights i could have stayed in a far nicer hotel for the same money I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone and will definitely not stay there again there was only a part roll of toilet paper there on arrival on the Sunday we went back to the room at 5pm to change for the evening and our room had not cleaned or clean towels.,5.4
Location was great communal are was nice. On the 5th floor and 1 elevator and a very noisy one at that. Took a while to get to sleep with the constant noise.,6.3
Room 511 is the smallest on that floor nice view breakfast was nice but not included extra fee neighborhood is great in the middle of everything the room was tiny even for a new hotel that is trying to be ultra hip the welcome glass of cava is a nice touch. Contemporary art in public spaces Small rooms with minimal closet space,8.3
Location was excellent. All areas in Antwerp were reachable by foot in a few minutes. Breakfast was ok although there was not too much no choice. Clean and comfortable. Slept well. Nothing negative to say. Breakfast could be more selective.,10
Breakfast was great . Location perfect very clean friendly staff would recommend  Lights in room could be better,8.3
The location was great and the facilities were very clean. The room was light and bright. ,10
Location Breakfast Average .. no FREE choice but good products Rooms are small ..,6.7
Prosecco at check-in and the happy hour appetizers and drinks is GREAT!! Room are modern/industrial styled. Great location great staff great hotel! My third time staying here and I love it. ,10
Drinks and snacks offered and friendly staff Not enough room to unpack clothes.,9
Friendly staff good location outside courtyard was nice. The room was very cold and clinical no character or warmth very small bath/shower and the glass walls of the bathroom do not give any privacy it was obvious that the hotel was built on a budget stark white lighting in hallways etc makes it feel more like an office than a hotel. We stayed in room 209 and every morning from approx 8am we could hear alot of noise i would assume from cleaning staff above us (sounded like tables or chairs being dragged over the concrete above our room this lasted for hours very disappointing as me and my partner love to sleep in. The bed was super soft which was not comfortable and my partner who has allergies noticed that the room was very dusty.,5
Everyone was so friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble Great breakfast and would go back again Firmer mattress,9.2
Locationfriendly staff Shower and in general the room is quite budget looking. Reminds me Ibis. Shower is built in in the room,6.7
It was the second time I stayed here. Its the perfect location and very clean and friendly staff. Free drinks are a nice touch. The room was a bit warm!,9
Free bar and food snacks every night whats not to like I think the light in the room wasnt bright enough for me difficult when applying make up but this is my only complaint,9
rich breakfast. nice staff very good place no hotel parking public just round the corner - paid,8.8
Aperitivo moment bed Wifi didnt work well,8
Staff very friendly and helpful. Dog friendly with good walks by parking area. Excellent breakfast included in price. Would stay again. Narrow stairs up to room a bit awkward with luggage and dogs. View over fire escape and bins could have been better.,8.8
Everything was fine. Due to corona outbreak. they brought the breakfast to the room. Very very helpful. Liked everything.,10
Everything Bed wasnt very comfortable,9.6
Els the cuisiniere makes fabulous omlettes and adds to the pleasant atmosphere of the hotel. She is always cheerful and helpful. ,7.5
Staff and breakfast! Change the room in arrival because of some problem with the door and the new room has a not very nice bathroom.,6.7
Great modern room decor and easy to find location. Dinner and breakfast were superb and the staff were very friendly. The bed was very soft and it would be nice if they had family rooms with beds for children instead of a sofa bed.,9.6
The hotel is clean and comfortable with a very good lively bar and restaurant which seems to be open from breakfast through to chucking out time. Parking is plentiful and convenient. Staff are friendly and professional. The restaurant food and service are typically Belgian - i.e. very good. Breakfast is great and the lady serving it very cheerful so you get a nice start to the day. A lot of rooms face out onto a fairly busy main road so if you have an issue with noise (like I do) youre going to have difficulty getting a room to suit you.  The car park is big and convenient but has a gravel surface. Not brilliant for heavily laden hotel guests with roller-fitted suitcases. The might want to consider tarmacking it.,8
Very friendly and welcoming staff. Good brasserie for dinner and breakfast. Very mediocre cleaning  There were chips in the bed. Smell of dust.,4
Staff very accommodating food fantastic. Clean quiet and comfortable. Dont think there was anything I didnt like.,9.6
bedroom and bathroom both good sizes  location good / parking good / check out good  / Friendly staff no complaints hotel good standard at the right price.,8.8
Liked the look the rooms the spacious bathroom the breakfast is to die for and thats why we keep coming back Nothing looks Pretty good to me.,10
We were not able to check in before the reception closed. So we called and asked if we could come later. And there a night entrance where the left the room key for me which was very kind! ,8
Very friendly staff very good breakfast! ,9.6
Good size room clean and nice. Lovely breakfast and very helpful kind staff.  The wallpaper could use some gluing back.some areas of the room had hanging wallpaper. We booked a double room but our bed was 2 single beds put together with the gap in the middle. ,8.8
Convenient for city centre quiet and sufficient A small degree of flexibility and warmth. Rules are rules are rules dont expect any flexibility whatever circumstance or situation you find yourself in,5
Location was super so close to the main square but in a quiet location  with a restaurant and bar on its doorstep if you didnt want to venture far after a long day exploring the beautiful city plenty of bars and restaurants close by  just a stroll away and train station within easy walking distance the proprietors were very friendly and had good advice to offer on where to find places of particular interest to us our room was sizeable and comfortable and made up every day the continental breakfast was more than sufficient to start the day. In our opinion we couldnt find anything to dislike,9.6
The breakfast was better than expected.  Great food and plenty of choices.  We especially enjoyed the  baked goods and homemade jam. The only thing that would have been  better was a walk-in shower.,10
Everything about this hotel was perfect! The beds are super comfy and the staff were helpful and friendly. Ill definitely be recommending this hotel to family and friends and already looking into booking a 2nd visit here. I am surprised it is only a 3 star. Should be a 5 star! Nothing! Our visit was amazing.,10
Great location nice clean room. Breakfast was pricey at $16 per person.,10
The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  The location is great (in the centre of Bruges) and the bedroom even though small it was clean.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. Breakfast.  One had to reserve for breakfast and it was late for us (at 08h00).,7
Central location.Excellent breakfast and clean rooms. Very nice atmosphere in the hotel. We did not like the curtain in the bathtub.,9.2
Very friendly staff and location was excellent. Stay at this Hotel you wont regret it! ,10
 The breakfast is not very good.There is no fruit.,7.5
Hotel very central to centre.clean good breakfast. N/a,10
Room was very spacious with a central location (five minutes walk from the central square). I had forgotten that breakfast was included so that was a bonus thing to be reminded of. Receptionist gave us a map of the area and some pointers of where to visit which was great and we could leave our bags after checking out on the last day for a while whilst we explored further. Great. ,9
Breakfast was fine a fair choice of pastries etc. plenty of juice and hot drinks available. The location of the hotel was great a quiet little square within easy distance of the main square just a few minutes walk.  The room was very comfortable huge bed!  The bathroom was also a very good size plenty of towels and hot water such a deep bath lovely. Difficult to think of something I didnt like perhaps lack of a view but I didnt book this hotel to stare out of a window.,9.6
Good balance price/quality. Great location. Clean and cozy rooms. Everything was good.,8.8
Location excellent and Hosts very good with their local knowledge ,10
Warm and friendly welcome when arriving to the hotel lots of useful information about the city. The room was bigger than expected. Could have have bigger pillows on the bed.,10
Really good value. Fantastic beds rooms were clean toiletries provided in bathroom. Very close to everything. Just fantastic. Allowed us to leave suitcases there securely before we checked in and after we checked out.  Lovely continental breakfast. ,10
Great location V tired hotel needs a re-vamp as does the staff,7.1
Beautiful and comfortable room fantastic location (quiet but close to everything you need) lovely breakfast and friendly owners. Our stay at Hotel Biskajer was brilliant and we will definitely be back! ,10
Location clean comfortable really nice bath ,10
The city is very nice and the location of the hotel is very good The staff is very bad. No polite. He knocked my door 10:55 am to ask me to leave the room in five minutes. I have experience from many hotels and this is the worst,7
Great location. Lovely breakfast room. Staff are extremely helpful and will make useful suggestions. Nothing.,10
Excellent location nice quiet rooms good breakfast and friendly helpful staff. We will return Tea/Coffee making facilities in room,9
Quaint hotel very close to the centre.  Minimal breakfast but nothing to complain about.  Restaurant next door was fabulous   Would definitely recommend this hotel Na,8.3
Friendly staff good location close to public car park ,8
Clean descent price close to city centre ,9
Great location value for money and very clean Everything was good,10
Our hosts were exceptional.  Helpful in every way.  The room was well prepared and looked out over the quiet square in front of the hotel straight at a large  shady Linden tree.Straight around the corner is a lovely restaurant and also the free shuttle bus to the station and P&O  ferry shuttle station ( close to the railway)We will absolutely stay there again!! No complaints,10
Room was clean staff were very friendly and the breakfast was large and tasty. Shower cubicle was a bit small for my liking. Parking could be an issue but thats the city itself.,8
Good location clean bedroom and breakfast room. Nice croissants and bread and a good coffe machine which also makes nice hot chocolate. Lift is helpful though small as the stairs are steep and quite tight if carrying anything heavy. Toilet paper was really cheap and thin. Breakfast: sad choice of a bit of ham and cheese no fruit.Check in just basic info no real interaction.,8
Vending machine for beer. I got lost trying to find the hotel every day though thats my fault.,9.6
Ideal location just a couple of minutes walking from most city highlights. The room was clean and cozy. Taking into account the room prize I would expect a bit more. For example there was not even a water cooker in the room one could only get tea or coffee downstairs only black tea in this case. We also did not book the breakfast because check-out was before 11am.,6.7
Excellent hotel very clean lovely breakfast. Staff very hospitable. I would recommend this hotel if staying in Bruges. I would have liked to have a kettle in the bedroom to make a cup of tea and coffee instead of going to the ground floor.,10
Excellent location Rude staff had only one key and cannot enter the hotel (even during the day) without the key vending machine had a defect so there was no drinkable water in the hotel.,5.4
The room was small but comfortable. Breakfast was plentiful and very good. Slightly bigger room.,10
Good location - given a key for front door access - nice bar nextdoor Perhaps tea or coffee in the room,10
The room the decoration the quietness helpful staff the swimming pool the bed was a bit hard,9
Everything! No tea pot for brewing  tea! Do you have teapots?,10
Everything clean comfortable rooms and excellent food Nothing,10
I spent an excellent and comfortable stay the necessary arrangements have been made regarding covid restrictions. Warmly recommend it. ,10
Well sited hotel easy parking excellent facilities friendly staff and fine dining. ,10
Very clean property with very good food and very friendly staff. ,10
Food is fantastic staff is very friendly ,9
Great location close to the lake. Wonderful dinner!! ,9.6
Clean professional modern yet with character efficient staff well kept property food excellent staff friendly. Bed confortable the pool was a great surprise. Kids friendly. Nice playground just opposite the hotel. Our room was on the small side but fit an extra bed for a child. It was all very cosy. Bedroom well arranged.  Our bedroom faced the car park on first floor just above the entrance so it was a little noisy in the evening with guests standing outside or smoking outside. Smoking should not be allowed so near the entrance of the hotel. Summer can get hot so air conditioning would be a plus. ,9
Swimming pool Bad wifi room too hot (had to sleep with opened window),8
Alles was tiptop in orde. Keuken was superklasse! ,10
could not have breakfast I had to check out 1h before breakfast the room smelt of sweat and I asked for a lunchpakket because I would not be able to have breakfast seeing it is only served from 8h and chcked out at 6:30 the lunchpakket was made a day well before hand. so when it was time to eat I passed on that. Also monday and tuesday the restuarant is closed one of the reasons I go to that hotel. pitty.,7
Butgenbach is close to a fantastic cycling path along a previous railway from the Vennbahn in Belgia to Junkerath in Germany. Staying over on Butgenbacher Hof the hotel experience is good with a very good restaurant and friendly hotel staff. We have stayed in the hotel before this time there is nothing negative to mention.,9.2
Very good service. Friendly staff. Very good restaurantservice at our room. Nothing,8
The friendliness of the staff and proprietors. The handsome beauty of De Haan and the ambiance of the hotel building the cleanliness the car parking the garden the honesty bar and many other things contributing towards a very pleasant stay. Also its not far from the E40 for trips to Bruges Ghent and beyond. Perhaps only the stairs to the top floor but little else! I would blame the current Euro exchange rate for not giving it a top value rating!,9.6
Excellent continental breakfast. Other facilities are on a honesty box basis. Good parking and the set up means you have the room without being fussed over unless you require anything. ,9.6
Excellent breakfast - a bonus was the little kitchen with free tea and coffee and a small kitchenette with microwave. Complementary home made cakes and biscuits  is a lovely touch. Also drinks in good fridge on an honesty basis is a very good idea.  I was able to rent a room electric cool box for 2 euros per day for my Cava!! nothing,10
Excellent breakfast very friendly multi-lingual staff quiet big light room and cake and coffee/tea available throughout the day. Whats not to like! ,9
Good honesty bar & breakfast great location Could do with a lick of paint! 90 Euro for 1 night but pricey ! But it was a bank holiday,5.4
Very nice hotel. Great location. Sure to go back again! Close to the beach. Close to the city centre. Close to the tram station. Close to restaurants. With Corona the restaurants are closed but there is take away options. There is also a Delhaize with great food options as well.,10
We stayed in a little house (called stuga in Swedish) in the garden. Very convinient and by ourself.The breakfast was one of the better we ever had (included big fancy hotels).The family owning and operating the house were so nice and helpful. ,10
Big room ground floor eggs were baked for you at breakfast good coffee sufficient parking space friendly staff .. ,9.6
The location the room was nice and people very friendly and helpful .Very good breakfast with also very good restaurants in the neighbourhood . not,9.2
One of the best small hotels I have ever stayed at. Great hosting clean spacious room good breakfast quiet setting adequate parking and only 15 minute drive into Maastricht town centre. Also some good restaurants within easy walking distance. Will certainly return. Very minor observation - lack of door to shower room which housed the toilet could be an issue for some people who like their privacy!,10
The personnel is very friendly. They really help you. The WiFi experience is good.The breakfast was well prepared.You do get a lounge in the shade of your terrace.  The hotel doesnt have an air conditioning on the room its very manageable.The coffee is alright but might be bitter for some. ,9
Upgraded to a large beautiful room with sliding glass doors out on to a patio area and garden.  Lovely bathroom with a great shower. Fantastic breakfast with plenty of choice. Would definitely stay again.  Nothing,10
Very quiet room quiet hotel in general. Perfect for us traveling with a 2-month-old baby and a 2 and a half old boy. Fabienne was always available and friendly. The village is cute clean and nice to stroll around. Many restaurant options. We recommend Het oude gerechtshof in the village and Pizzeria Al Mulino just 15km from the hotel through the countryside. ,9
Very nice breakfast! Enough things to choose from! Spacey rooms! Terrace outside Very clean! Very kind staff! I could hear the neighbours with a little child through the wall a bit so not totally soundproof.,8.8
This is a great hotel ideally located for exploring the sites of Bruges. The staff were very friendly and helped with any questions we had. Our room was very spacious and comfortable and the continental breakfast including omelettes etc was very tasty. The bathroom was clean with a free-standing bath and two sinks only negative was that there was no separate shower.,9.6
breakfast + location + staff Single room too small+ lamp & kettle  electrical cables too short,7.9
Fantastic location really close to all the sights and museums. Nice breakfast. Very friendly staff. Decent size family room. The room we had looks out on a street that remained lively until the early morning hours. Narrow spiral staircase can be a challenge for people with impaired mobility but there are rooms on the ground floor - be sure to ask for one if you need it.,9.6
Staff & location Vertical Shower support kept slipping down on the pole & came off completely making showering awkward. Just needed a little maintenance.  Left mantras needs to be replaced as the springs are very evident under the sheets.,7.5
The room was very large and very clean and comfortable. The staff were so friendly and helpful breakfast was amazing and location was just perfect!  Nothing,10
Quirky hotel. Lovely staff. Fabulous location ,10
Great location in centre of city. Staff were very helpful. The buffet breakfast was exceptionally good with lots of variety & I was offered an early one on the day of the marathon should I want it. Nothing,9
Great location adorable 4-person room looked like it was built by elves good breakfast friendly staff  Lots of stairs! Ok for us but not for anyone with mobility challenges. There are some rooms on the ground floor but ours was up several narrow winding flights.,10
Friendly staff great location quite and a good breakfast.  Very steep stairs,9.6
Great location and friendly staff. The breakfast was good specially the fresh cooked eggs. There was a roof window in the bathroom that the apartments next door could potentially look through. I didnt felt too comfortable about it.,8.3
Very polite and pleasant staff. Perfect location surrounded by good restautants and coffee shops. Recommended! Rooms look better in reality than in the pictures. Also a paid parking is just nearby very convenient. ,10
Very helpful and happy staff all round a great stay. Will definitely be coming back. Nothing not to like.,10
Very friendly staff who managed to secure a wonderful room for us. The breakfast was excellent and brought to us daily and everyone was very nice and helpful Nothing to dislike!,9
Room staff breakfast. Great location.  Confusion at reception about parking.,10
Location is perfect! Very close to the Market square the main place of the city. The breakfast is delicious one of the best croissant I have ever had. The staff is very kindly too! There is no lift so you need to carry the luggage via stairs. But this was a very small thing compared to the other good features of the hotel.,9.6
Friendly staff easy to find good parking and yummy breakfast. ,8
Location was absolutely fantastic.  Breakfast was quite fine without being outstanding.  Lovely staying in a building with character and history.    The hosts were very helpful with recommendations for dinner.  Loved Poules et Moules! We were in a room up 2 flights of stairs so a bit difficult with 2 suitcases weighing 18 kg each!  Perhaps you might put those traveling from afar eg Australia on lower levels?  Many travelling from a distance come to Europe for a few weeks so have more luggage.  Next time we will request a room on a lower floor.  But we enjoyed our stay and loved your town.,7.9
The Breakfast was very good and nicely presented. The location is excellent5 minutes from The Belltower. I wouldnt think the hotel is suitable for anybody with any mobility problems as we had some very steep stairs to get to our room.They probably have some ground floor rooms though. I couldnt find anything wrong with The Boterhuis and we will probably stay again.,7.9
Great location and friendly staff as well! Super nice breakfast! ,10
Room was big and had a good view of the street with quiet doubled up windows. Breakfast was good and not too busy. Mattress was old but fine.,9.2
The location was excellent walkable to everything we wanted to see. The room was spacious and comfortable we had the room right on the street but still felt like it was private and quiet at night. The breakfast spread was excellent too so nice to have eggs made fresh for us every morning in addition to the meats cheeses and croissants. Would highly recommend this hotel. ,10
The staff and the location were excellent. Couldnt ask for more. Parking nearby was secure though quite tight so dont expect a big car to be easy. Brilliant B&B for a walking visit of Bruges. Dog friendly as well! ,9
Looked for and found a very different property in s Central location . As expected no parking at hotel ?? But reservation made at nearby additional charge car park .,9.2
Outstanding customer service skills good breakfast nice room Employees courtesy,9.6
 Room lovely but booked because older worldly and our room very modern and painting building so entrance like shop front. Xxxx,7.5
The staff was very friendly and helpful and the building beautifully renovated. Very charming. The location was perfect to explore Bruges The bathroom was a bit narrow and the toilet placed in the main room separated by a door that would not close properly which is of course due to the architecture and age of the old building - which is beautiful and totally charming (we were looking for this style of hotel) but worth to keep in mind. Covid obliged to have breakfast in our room and we took it in bed because only 1 chair was available in the room.. again no issue for us but could be an issue for other people,8
An excellent location for your stay in Brugge. Very friendly staff. Large room with full en-suite. An excellent breakfast,9.6
Very nice property situated near to all of the squares. Only downfall was the amount of stairs!! Party of six with three rooms and all of our rooms were clean and spacious. Bathrooms were huge. Continental breakfast was very good. Staff were very friendly. Will definitely recommend. Stairs!!!!!,9.6
Charming doesnt begin to describe it. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly the location was perfectly central the rooms were gorgeous and comfortable and the breakfast was a surprisingly delightful bonus & lovely experience. We wished we could have stayed longer. ,10
This little boutique hotel was so close to everything we wanted to visit. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. ,10
They treated our dog Tobias with care and respect. It was got us impressed. Cornell was a guy that helped me with some prints and it was kind by him. ,9.2
Staff were extremely helpful and pleased to give advice on local restaurants etc. ,9.6
Everything was perfect and the staff could not be nicer location is great breakfast is lovely and our room was perfect in every way Absolutely nothing to dislike in this hotel. Do yourself a favour and see Bruges and stay in the Hotel Boterhuis.,10
Very helpful staff. Very good breakfast. It is a bit tired. The taps and door handles were loose and there was a shortage of coat hangers.,9.2
The location is great. Very friendly und helpful staff. The breakfast was very good. The room was very very very different from the picture on the web page. Small old with old furniture. The bed is without a table directly on the wall very uncomfortable only 2 pillows also uncomfortable. Bed linen didnt smell fresh were old frayed and worn with stains. The terrace was dirty. Wi- fi was slow. Draining from the shower was slow. No hangers in the bathroom. No mini fridge in the room. I cant recommend!!!,4.6
Overall the hotel was clean & in a great location for all the things we wanted to see in Bruges. The staff were courteous & helpful whatever we asked of them they were happy to assist. The breakfast was tasty with enough choice & you can eat as much of the buffet as you wanted. For us and this may have only been associated with our room! As a couple we always prefer a double bed rather than two singles pushed together! However we did not request this during our booking so there is a good chance that they would honour this request should we have made it. Also in our room the shower head seemed to be in the wrong place & soaked the floor. Neither was a massive problem for us & didnt dampen our enjoyment of the weekend break we had.,7.5
A great hotel located in the centre of Bruges with a very good breakfast and friendly - helpful staff!! Everything was fine :),10
Our room was right under the roof but in between other houses thats why it was very quite around and still we had nice views of roofs of buildings nearby :) ,10
This hotel really lived up to all its great reviews. The staff were pleasant cheerful and helpful. Our room was large and tastefully decorated. I had asked for a bath if possible and this was provided (huge bath!!) It was also quiet. It was possible to regulate the heating. The inclusive breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice - including fresh fruit cereal and eggs freshly cooked as one wanted. There was also a kettle in the room. Only ordinary tea and instant coffee provided so if you want something a bit different take a few tea bags or whatever. The location could not have been better - a few minutes stroll to the main square. We walked to and from the station but there is a frequent bus service. All in a a great place to stay. ,10
Great location.  Very friendly & helpful staff.  Excellent breakfast and eating area.  Room was very spacious & clean.  Nice private parking garage.  Overall an outstanding place to stay. Nothing.,10
Very friendly staff.  Charming and lovely hotel ,10
For a single person I was given a huge room and bathroom. Yay! Lovely and clean. Bfast was great. Staff lovely. Good location and quiet after hours (Renos on outside during the day but wasnt there) could make a cup of tea in my room. Would go back there for a stay again. Nothing.,10
 The staff make you feel at home as soon as you walk through the door. Always with a friendly smile,9.6
Location/faculty/room were amazing. More pillows on the beds/mini fridge in rooms would be nice but it didnt dampen our stay.,9
Breakfast fantastic eggs cooked to order. Great location close to main market place. Parking locally was fine. Spiralstairs could be challenging to some.  Bar not open until 6pm  not needed asbso close to centre.,10
A beautiful old and central hotel. 2 minute walk from the centre but far enough away to be quiet. The room was absolutely wonderful. It felt authentic and in keeping with the old and quirky Bruges. The bathroom was spotless and spacious with an incredible bath.  ,10
Lovely character & atmospher to the hotel  Breakfast  in courtyard was ezcellent. Having a bath as well as shower. Need more hooks & a chair in bathroom. handrail in shoser area,8.8
The setting write in the middle of town Breakfast Clean rooms  ,7.5
Smiling and friendly staff. Hearty breakfast. Comfortable beds. Location. Nothing I didnt like,10
Location decor friendly room amazing great breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.  Smoking in courtyard smells went through to breakfast room,10
Lovely old fashioned style of the room Dusty air in the bedroom,9.6
The location was very close to the city center. The hotel breakfast was excellent. The room was clean and met all expectations. Staff was very pleasant and helped with directions restaurant recommendations etc. ,9.6
Staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Location couldnt be better. We had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone. ,10
Choice of continental breakfast or eggs. All nice and fresh The breakfast room is a little cramped,8.3
Great location great breakfast great ac!!!! Dark windy stairs at night.,10
loved the location and room and very friendly staff. ,10
The hotel is great in a perfect location lovely family run hotel.My only thing to add is that it has a very steep winding staircase I dont think the hotel has an elevator anyone elderly it could be a problem. ,10
Location and the hotel overall. Carparking wasnt available around the corner. Alternative parking not easy to find.,8.8
Great location just a walking distance from Belfort. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Couple of really decent beer bars nearby. Quiet outside! 20 minutes walk from railroad station. Full size bathtub in the bathroom! The bed was uncomfortable mattress seemed to be worn out.,8.3
Everything! Great location and an amazing place. Our room was fantastic with a view over beautiful old rooftops breakfast was great and the staff sooooo helpful. Will be recommending it to friends and Bruges also. Great few days. Booked parking and glad we did... ,10
Beautiful big room lovely breafast lovely staff excellent location. Great value for money and just a wonderful place to stay in a beautiful town  ,10
Breakfast was delicious with a continental spread offered and hosts cooking eggs scrambled fried or boiled.  Room was a very good size as was the bathroom which was very modern and clean. We had the window open all night and didnt hear a thing other than the church bells in the distance. This was a pleasant surprise to us as the hotel is literally a 2 minute walk to the main centre.  Parking is available in a nearby underground private carpark that is accessible at all times during your stay Loved the hotel Loved the city Loved the people!! The only thing we didnt like was that we had to leave so soon :(,10
Very friendly and helpful staff great breakfast and a very good location being just off the Market Square. Will be recommending it to family friends and colleagues. Cannot think of anything.,8.3
Perfect location for the grand market and city life with great breakfast as well ,10
Great location and  a comfortable room. Easy walk to everything. Breakfast was small but good. Would definitely stay here again. ,9.6
Beds were comfortable and the staff was super friendly. Great location! Just steps away from the square with tons of restaurants and shops. The room was a bit on the small side. As it rained quite a bit during our stay we stayed in our room and played some card games.,8
The location is perfect! The hotel was well maintained our room was spacious with all the amenities mentioned. Towels changed both days we stayed there. Breakfast was excellent with big variety. Ladies who prepare and serve breakfast are more than welcoming polite and always with a smile and a nice word. Overall a very nice experience ,8.8
Breakfast was good but can be better as we built more expectations ,9.6
Great location reasonable pricecomfortable room and good breakfast ,10
Loved the staff location and decor of the hotel. Great place to stay.  Due to having the triple room our double bed was two singles put together which ment we found the mattress separated during the night.,9.6
The room was nice and clean. The decoration is really good looking and the bathroom is wide and amazing. ,9
The hotel is nicely located and staff is extremely nice and helpful. Despite very small rooms these were clean. The rooms are rather small and the space for breakfast in the restaurant was not able to fit all guests.,8.8
Location very near to square walking distance to canal room clean comfortable staff very friendly. Nothing,9.6
Location was very good and staff were helpful Needs some updating,6.3
Lovely breakfastHappy staff. Very attentive. I had an operation so i asked for extra pillows and the receptionist bought me one straight away.  Receptionist sho2ed me nice places to eat on a map and reccomended things to do. Minutes a way from the centre by foot.  The hotel was brilliant. Nice and chic. Would have loved a bath tub but not too fussed. Also cheaper if you book there instead of booking.com. Also the aircondition didnt have a warm setting. I was sort of cold at one point.,10
Lovely people friendly and helpful. Property is quirky and cosy but stylish. Spacious room with excellent bathroom. Good breakfast. Excellent location. Would definitely come again. ,9
Cool rooms in a great location. The breakfast was excellent. This hotel is perfect distance to the square and was so fun for the kids very very clean beds were comfortable. Quiet and spacious.  The layout is kind of funny expect narrow stairs and no elevators. But you cant beat the neat old building.,10
The location was quiet but very near all the old town sites. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was terrific with your choice of cooked-to-order eggs. Hotel Boterhuis offers high quality for good value. ,10
Excellent character to the property and excellent breakfast and service Not applicable,10
Lovely property 2 minute walk from historic central square .  Breakfast was generous and served in a charming courtyard.  Staff was so helpful and friendly gave us excellent dinner suggestions one of which was an excellent foodie-gastro pub and bar right next door.  The room was modern with a stunning bathroom and immaculate .  The location couldnt be better.  Id stay here again without question next time Im in Bruges. Nothing !,10
Location less than 2 mins walk from the market square. Nice breakfast. Nothing at all,8.3
Fab location to use as a base to explore Bruges. ,10
Perfect location good advice where to eat room was equipped for our take away dinner as restaurants all closed very clean and rules respected convenient breakfast in the room super kind lady at the reception who did everything she could to make our stay comfortable. Would go back. Nothing,10
Breakfast was very good and the bed was extremely large and comfortable Needed hooks and rails in the bathroom to hang up clothes and towels.,7.9
The location of this hotel is perfect - 5min walk to the Markt where pretty much everything is. Its a 5min taxi ride from the train station too. The hotel has so much character very historic and even has a kick of modern in the corridor. Our room had an enormous fireplace wooden beams and chandelier so we werent disappointed. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great lots of choices and cool basement. The taps in bathroom were very loose.,9.6
Hotel located in old city center. Room is clean and comfortable and furnished in old style. The bathroom is big. Good breakfast is included and the room contains kettle. ,8.8
Lovely hotel good value for money quiet location would definitely come back. Great hosts... ,8
Amazing location light airy rooms good facilities and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Tea and coffee available in room but no milk available,8.3
Staff sympathy Stairs are big challenge for our luggage,9.6
The staff was very friendly. Location bang in the centre but it was very quiet too.  The breakfast was excellent. The only thing is that the mattress was a bit too soft. Although the sachets of shower gels and soaps were adequate it would be better for the environment to provide these in dispensers. The little sachets of soaps and shampoos  The mattress,9
The room was great! Very cozy and a lot of room. The bathroom with bath was amazing! Very good value for money. Located about 5 minute walk from the city center which is great.  The breakfast - in corona times - was in the room and was really good and more than enough! Fresh orangejuice croissants cereal fruit ..  Would stay here again. It was my girlfriends birthday and the owner arranged for flowers at breakfast. ,9
Very close to the market and other attractions. Very clean and spacious room exceptionally friendly staff! No dislikes.,10
Iloved this place.  The staff are super nice the location is great the building is beautiful and the breakfast is really delicious.  The room is huge and comfortable. Not sure if this is a local thing but the building is very poorly lit in the corridors and stairs.  The stairs are spiral and no lifts so at night it is a bit hazardous going up to our room with luggage.,9.6
Breakfast area and food was amazing.   Nice little private patio.  Room was good size and had everything needed.  Modern bathroom. Had to get housekeeping to clean up cobwebs on ceiling.   At check-out the computer did not work so we had t wait while the lady figured out what to do but we were in a rush to catch a train.   A little nerve racking.  Not enough counter space in the bathroom.,7.5
Excellent breakfast.   Old historic building with ambience. The loo was a bit uncomfortable very high off the floor! The duvets were too thick for us but sleeping without them was too cold.   A sheet and blanket as an alternative would have been good although we didnt actually ask if this could be provided.,8.3
Breakfast was goodloved the quirky breakfast room . Very friendly staff. Room was excellent quiet and very comfy . Great to have secure parking so we could forget about car and enjoy the area by foot . ,7.5
Perfect location. Lovely staff.  Comfortable rooms. Good breakfast. Will highly recommend. ,10
The Staff was very helpful and the food is very lovely and a lot of options the place is very near of the city center and to easy to reach the room was small but very lovely and cozy :) ,10
Lovely staff great breakfast and excellent location.  ,10
This was our favorite! The breakfast was awesome and the people were wonderful. The room was beautiful and the location was great. We walked to everything and had a fabulous time. Nothing,10
Location and understated b&b type atmosphere excellent breakfast polite staff Odd failings kettle could only sit on floor next to bed because of length of cable large towels only arrived in the afternoon for some strange and unannounced reason small details and not anything to stop me recommending,9.6
Good breakfast  . Very friendly helpful staff.  Excellent central location All fine,9
Stayed in the lovely attic room. The beds were very comfy and the duvets very warm. All good,9.6
The location was outstanding.  We could walk to everything we wished to see in the old town.  The food was delicious and the outdoor dining charming. Nothing,10
Great location. Modern decor with a classic Bruge feel. Absolutely lovely hotel. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast very nice. An overall amazing experience. Stairs were very narrow but thats always the case in Bruge so didnt at all ruin our stay.,10
Great location really big family room really good breakfast pleasant and very helpful staff Everything was great we just had some difficulty in navigating the spiral staircase to our 2nd floor room as we had heavy luggage. We managed fine. ,10
The breakfast was simple but good. They have this sort of underground cave-like area which works as a second breakfast room pretty amazing! Its very close to the old town center. Quite a few things to see at walking distance from the hotel. The hotel itself was in this quirky old building which was pretty interesting. The stairs were small and we ended up using a spiral stairway to carry our bags up which was a little difficult. The bathroom didnt seem to have any ventilation. There was a little side street near our balcony where youd have people stopping to chat out loud and sometimes school children you could also hear cars with the windows open. Not a huge deal though.,7.9
The hotel was a great choice for a city trip to Bruges located in a charming old building few minutes walking from the main market square. The ladies running the place were very kind and helpful and we had a very good breakfast even if it was served in the room due to the pandemic.. The room we had was clean and large with comfortable beds. We also used the private parking few steps away from the hotel but that was not a problem. We definitely recommend this place and we will not hesitate coming back at some point :-) There werent really negative points maybe just a visual embarrassment brought by the works around the hotel they were killing a bit the charm of the surroundings but that is something you cannot avoid :-),8
Friendly and helpful staff the breakfast was very good (bread cheeses meat eggs cereal etc) It a very nice location. The parking is easily accessible and all the major highlights are within walking distance. Be sure to reserve parking space in advance as it is limited.  ,10
Very close to the city centre The stairs are STEEP!,7.9
We had a private courtyard and a small atrium we could eat our breakfast in.  It was very cozy.  Breakfast was also delicious.  Everyone at the front desk is welcoming and friendly.  It feels like youre visiting a friends house.  The shower was also great. Public parking is right around the corner and easy to get to. ,9
Breakfast was fantastic the staff were super helpful and location was perfect! Just wish we could have seen more of the Inn. Next time! ,9
Very good location central located.  Nice restaurants and Bars nearby. ,9.2
Clean hotel a little too much grey pain for our liking but did not detract from our weekend. Continental breakfast was good and staff helpful. Door to bathroom stuck on floor all the time,7.9
It was a family room. It was nicely organised at the top of the building (two beds on one side of the room for the children and a double bed for the parents) so it was fun for the kids and comfortable for the adults. We particularly appreciated that there was a table and four chairs in the room with cutlery and crockery which made our stay very comfortable in this time of pandemics when eating out is not possible. Probably that at the time (Easter 2021) there were some works in the street. Obviously not the fault of the hotel but it was the only inconvenient that I can find. Also perhaps the lighting in the room could be improved as one of the little side lamps did not work and they were not good enough for reading. But overall it is a great place.,9
Brekfast was amazing especially eggs!! Everbody in hotel is really cute kind and friendly. Location was super. The room was really clean. ,10
I received a warm welcome the room was clean and a perfect size for one person. The air conditioning was a bonus as it was very hot weather. Breakfast great and lovely staff. Nothing,10
Very nice room big bathroom. Very friendly staff familiar atmosphere. Delicious breakfast. ,9.6
Great location with easy walking distance to the town centre. Lovely breakfast. Really nice room. Check out the local bar round the corner VolksCafe- classic hit music and fun It was all very nice.  No Complaints,9.6
Lovely welcome.  All the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I found the bed uncomfortable I am afraid due to a very poorly fitting and crackly mattress protector.,9
Location location.  Near Market square and several excellent restaurants yet not in the most crowded areas so quiet at night. Great breakfast. Very cordial staff.  Our family of four got two rooms and they adjoined and one was very spacious the other not too small. The photos led me to believe that the gracious curved and arched exterior was the hotel entrance. Actually it is a view down a side street next to the hotel.  Its an old hotel made of multiple buildings so we had to go through hallways out back through a courtyard then into another building and up some very steep narrow stairs to get to our rooms.,7.5
Great location friendly staff lovely spacious room! Really enjoyed our stay!! ,10
The location and the staff were wonderful. The bed wasnt very comfortable. There was an odd lumpy mattress cover.,9.2
Quirky a good breakfast much character excellent location for access to the town Bathroom cramped room very hot,7.9
Great staff. Beds a little uncomfortable as two single beds were pushed together.,8.8
The location is perfect the hotel is situated on a main road into Bruges city centre our room was at the back theres a church opposite which rang the bells from 8am every hour. Breakfast is included and they take your every need into account very friendly they give you a free map of the city and mark any location you want to visit The only thing that we didnt like was our shower didnt stay in the right position it kept dropping down so we had to tie it up with a plastic bag,9.6
Central location. Excellent rooms. Breakfast was a little basic but acceptable. Friendly and efficient staff. More breakfast options.,9.6
Everythinh Difficult maneuver stairs and luggage,7.5
Very clean It was good except the room was with a closed street view and the windows were not sound proof so it was noisy and we couldnt really sleep late we had to wake up early.,7
The location is probably the best in Bruges. Our room was EUR 150 and we had a beautiful view. Breakfast was painful however. Despite Corona rules everyone arrived at breakfast at the same time and one member of staff was policing all the food. She was borderline rude and disorganised but you could tell that she thought that she was doing a great job. The food itself was very uninspired but that is typical of Bruges. From a culinary point of view Bruges is pathetic. still serving the same crap as in the 70s 80s 90s.. The town however is so delightful that most of the time one doesnt really care. And the beer is always good of course. see above,7
Loved the room huge bed bath and tea making equipment. The location of hotel is central but not noisy. Booked through Booking.com. Price quoted included hotel tax. This was charged to my bill again. Could not dispute as I did not have a copy of my booking,9.2
Great location! Friendly staff Breakfast could be a little improved under the current pandemic context as well as the room facilities for eating.,7
Its exactly in the center of Brugge very beautiful the restaurant for the breakfast has the river view (you have to take breakfast there)The staff very friendly and helpful  ,9.2
Perfect location .. Very clean and comfortable roomsGreat friendly staff.. only just tucked away from the main square And a very short walk to loads of great restaurants and kerbside bars/Pubs .. pretty little Venice possibly!! Would have preferred a room at the back of the hotelAs street noise might disturb you if your a light sleeper .. the odd car etc .But its not too bad on the whole. And probably not worth worrying about .. ,9.2
The staff was verry vriendly and helpfull. The room was verry clean and the bed was good. The heater wasnt working and it was a little bit cold in the room.,9.2
The building is beautiful. A great combination of modern and old. The location is fabulous. Staff were helpful and polite. A lovely hotel. Breakfast didnt suit us as my partner only liked croissants from what was on offer and there were none left.,9.6
The view was magical on the canal both day and night. It felt very relaxing and soothing. The hotel room was warm and comfortable with a soft bed. The location of the hotel itself was perfect in the old town centre.  We had Room 321 and the bath/ shower Set up was in a low roof space area so bath it had to be. It was however a small price to pay for the view out the window.,10
Fabulous location beautiful building friendly helpful reception and breakfast room staff. Very nice self service continental buffet breakfast. ,8.3
Beautiful hotel right in the center of everything.  The staff was Very helpful. I couldnt ask for more. ,10
It is a beautiful old building along the canal. It also has a modern part to the hotel which was in the process of completion while we were there. Its very convenient to the Square and other sites. All walking distance. Good Italian restaurant across the road. It didnt have a nice cosy area to sit read and have a drink.,9.2
The staff was great very clean room great location nice breakfast with amazing canal view ,7.9
The location of the hotel was good only a few minutes walk from the market square and all the other amenities. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean throughout. There were too many levels in some of the rooms with step ups and downs and there was a lack of light switches near the beds in my instance you had to get out of bed to turn off the light above the bed the door into the bathroom didnt quite open fully and was a little bit difficult to shut properly.,6
Loved the traditional yet modern vibe to the hotel ,8
 The pictures on booking.com did not relate to the hotel as I explained to the staff I felt it was false advertising. I changed from a different hotel to this one based on the photographs. I would recommend it to be removed from the site .,1
Old and interesting The hotel was fine we were only there for two nights So no real mod cons but the building is old an beautiful with great views so makes up for lack of facilities it has two interesting neighbours on one side a sex shop on the other a torture museum so caused much amusement ,8.8
Very nice clean and quiet and with great personnel. I loved staying there and am looking forward to return  ,9
The location is fantastic - absolutely could not be better in Bruges!  Our room had windows on the canal - which would be even more appealing in warm weather in December we still sat in them frequently and opened them a few times.  The staff was friendly helpful and efficient and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was filling and convenient and served in a room with another spectacular view over the canal. Compared to the general good quality of the key comfort elements of a hotel room (bed sheets shower towels) the towels were subpar.  They were worn out - overwashed stiff and not very absorbent.  The other odd thing is that the door to the bathroom (toilet included) in our room was translucent glass - could have done without that.,8.8
Great location and very comfortable. Second time Ive stayed there. ,9.2
Bread at breakfast was excellent Bar area was more like a waiting room. Not somewhere appealing to sit.,10
Great location just off the canal and main square. 5-10 minutes walk max to the tourist bits. Far away enough to not hear anything. Staff really helpful. Borrowed an iron and given top ups for tea coffee and sugar at reception. Room was spot on. Stayed 2 nights for ¬£92! Wow what a bargain. Will be coming back 110%.  No faults at all.,10
Everything is perfect..good stay overall ,10
They were thinking we are going to have lunch and dinner at the hotel because of the COVID so the put a table and two chairs in the room. Well done but it could have been better if they put some tableware and forks. Great staff and rooms were cozy.  The breakfast was a little messy and limited for me. We only had some breads and no fruit to choose. We were given a bag with all the necessary item but we didnt have spoons and knives. It was okey in general but could have been a better experience with the breakfast. The staff was super friendly. ,9
Lovely smart and modern hotel Excellent location. Modern rooms and friendly staff.,10
The easy access to everything I wanted to visit. It was very nice!!! We had a little issue the first night. We had a leak somewhere so the shower water was cold.but the next day was ok,7.1
recently renovated but original charater kept bathroom is dated. heating needs constant adjustment,8.3
Really comfy hotel bathroom excellent size. Breakfast was amazing value for money. ,9.6
Efficient service clean rooms modern touch to an ancient building and great location for centre of Bruges  Breakfast was bit limited in choice.,8.3
Great location and view Oldish room - outdated,7
Nice spacious room. I liked the fact that several extra blankets were in the wardrobe. Everyone of the staff was very friendly. ,9.2
It is in a fantastic location.  There is also a really reasonable priced car park nearby as well. They are in the process of renovating the hotel and rooms.  Unfortunately we were in a room in need or renovation.  I booked a room with a canal view for my birthday and was disappointed with the price versus the quality of the room.  Our shower didnt work terribly well and when i tried to use the hotel hairdryer it caused a power cut!,7.1
Great central location.  Breakfast was ok with great views but the restaurant was outdated. ,8.8
 Breakfast was poor. All self service and crammed into small space.,9
Fabulous location by the canal. Room was very large and comfortable. Limited breakfast,8.3
Helpful pleasant staff.  Location.  Two easy chairs and table by window to enjoy the view of the canal. Bright flashing (every 15 seconds) LED ceiling smoke alarm unit it was extremely bright in the dark bedroom and as it was over the bottom of the bed very disturbing.  Poor quality waterproof rubber cover to mattress which was uncomfortable (made me hot) also made a noise everytime we moved.  Rubbish pillows.  Corridor doors (Fire Doors?) constantly propped open for the convenience of builders working.,7.1
Location is absolutely perfect - a few seconds from the markt and other beauty spots. Room size was great bed was comfortable wifi was great. Staff very polite. Value for money good as the price was very reasonable. Very quiet hotel with no disruption from noise. Amenities in the bathroom were disappointing. There was literally no holder for the shower head and no shower curtain or divider. This made it pretty difficult to have a decent shower - constantly had to hold the shower head and have water splashing everywhere. For a hotel of this standard I expected more people dont want to run a bath in the height of summer or when they just want to get fresh before dinner. Also the size and quality of the provided shampoo and shower gel was very poor and the towels were quite thin.,7
The hotel was very convenient.  Staff exceptionally helpful. Breakfast was ideal. ,9.6
Excellent location. The room was very spacious and we had a wonderful view of the canal. ,9.2
Rooms were amazing so new and modern as well as the reception area. Perfect position really friendly staff Gerard was so helpful and welcoming! That we had to leave,9.6
Excellent central location we were travelling by car and the charge for parking was reasonable.  We didnt have a canal side room but the view of the street was sufficiently entertaining! Bit of a hike to get to the car park.,8.8
It was clean and tidy and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and friendly. The bath was a health and safety hazard when showering as there was no non-slip capability in the form of either a rubber mat or rough surface.  We found it to quite dangerous.Also the basin in the bathroom could not be use  for anything other than cleaning our teeth since it had no plug to keep the water in for washing or shaving.Furthermore there was no toaster at breakfast so toast was not an option.,8.3
The location was very central. Gerard at the reception was very international and helpful. ,7.5
It was my third time in Bruges but I never get tired of this city. The hotel is next to the Rozenhoedkaai the most photographed place in Bruges. It is located right in the middle of the center and 2 min walk distance from everything !! (The Belfry The beer wall Choco-Story Markt De Halve Maan brewery..) The room is charming and cosy architecture is typical Belgian youll be next to the canals and the gooses. The staff is helpful and friendly. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay !!!  Nothing you pay for what you get. A perfect trip from A to Z. ,9
Amazing location.. entire interior of the hotel has been redone so its modern with nice big rooms although the dining area still maintains the original interiors which I thought was lovely and rustic. The hotel is right on a canal so you have breakfast overlooking the water. Great reception staff and superb pizza restaurant across the road (and tons of other restaurants within walking distance). ,9.6
Location Lack of mirror outside bathroom,8.3
I loved the hotel room very comfortable and warm. Clean facility and great location I have no complaints,10
Position Cleanliness and the breakfast Sometimes too much noise coming from outside,6.7
Good continental Breakfast. Great location. Friendly helpful staff. Would stay there again Rooms were clean but could do with a spruce up but looks like they are going through the whole place gradually,9
Location right in the center and not so far from train station  Close to shops museums and restaurants  In this sanitary context Take away and deliveries were made easy Cold water in the bathroom at the arrival but rapidly fixed by the staff,8
Best location nice and clean room good price and friendly staff ,10
It was a lovely quiet and relaxed stay in a beautiful part of Bruges. The glass door to the en-suite was a bit funny and the breakfast was underwhelming.,7.9
Location couldnt be better. Breakfast included was good. Staff were super helpful. ,10
This hotel is very central we had a beautiful room overlooking the canal with a big bath and huge bed. Coffee fresh towels and bedding was provided every morning with an optional breakfast. Room was really clean and a matter of metres from the market square!  Nothing!,10
The location was perfect Lovely quaint hotel. ,9
very good food available at other times of day would be nice,8
Few minutes walking from all places to visit on Bruges. Staff didnt answer my message sent via Booking. Minor There isnt a shower,9
The view of the canal.. amazing! Interior room furnishing could use a bit of a refresh.. but it was fine.,10
The hotels location is perfect and everything is both modern and classical at the same time. This provides a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The airconditioning was sometimes a little bit loud. The beds were technically not one large queen-sized bed but two separate beds put together and layered with a top mattrass. Nonetheless we didnt quite experience this as less comfortable but still,8
The location was amazing. Such a beautiful hotel that had everything we needed inside and right outside too. ,10
Easy access to central Bruges. Clean and modern rooms with a fantastic view of the canals from the breakfast room. Traffic noise in bedrooms adjacent to the road. Staff were more than willing moved us to a side room which solved the issue.,7
Great location and friendly staff. Hot rooms with no AC. Windows had no screenS so we couldnt leave them open without having a mosquito problem. Older facilities. Uncomfortable bed.  We switched rooms because the first room only had a bath tub and had no room for an adult to stand up.,7.9
The bed was comfortable and warm. Tea and coffee making facilities were good. We had a room with a view over the canal which was absolutely lovely. The young man at reception was friendly and helpful and directed us very well around the one way system in this ancient town towards the underground car park. The hotel was very central. Loved the Greek street-food place across the street. This was certainly the best food we had during our two-night stay. The rooms were actually quite basic: ours reminded me of one of the better youth hostels I have stayed in. The carpet was a little stained and I had to wash cleaning product residue out of the bath before I could use it. I realise that building works are currently being undertaken and front of house does look splendid.,7.9
Lovely hotel great staff and very comfortable room. ,9.2
Nothing but positive words for this stay. The hotel is perfectly situated in walking distance of  all attractions. We had two new rooms at the streetside with excellent isolation. If you are by car the parking Pandreitje is again in walking distance and almost a bargain at 8. 5 per day.I will definitely come back ,10
The location was excellent. The view from the breakfast table. The bed was very comfortable. Everything was a little sparse. By the kettle there was only one small bottle of water between us 2 teabags and 2 coffee sachets no milk. Very limited space for clothes for 2 people no information about Bruges in the room and even the pieces of soap were tiny. Wed paid extra for a standard room rather than a budget room and yet it was fairly small and Id thought would have a river view rather than a noisy road view.,6
The bed was great .we had a budget room so no air con so very hot on hottest day of year. Breakfast was great staff good Could not sit out side with out buying a drink I think was unfair,9.2
The view location clean nice service Bathroom bath tab under the sealing cant take a shower standing up not functional,9.2
I booked the room with canal view thats fantastic the room is very big and comfortable. Breakfast is ok and location is superb. You can walk from bus station to hotel within 2 minutes. Nothing,10
Beautiful view of the canal I highly recommend the canal view room huge rooms basic breakfast but walking distant to all the sights around town . Opposite the hotel is a great little restaurant that was reasonably priced too . Pizza Hut etc are all walking distance if you want.Right in front of the hotel is the canal cruises. 2 min walk . Just a little warning though there are pick pockets apparently in January in particular. These scum are professional and can get into zipper bags etc watch your belongings . Apart from that the town is just divine . Try the cherry beer too its yum !  ,10
Breakfast and location both excellent. There was less food available for our last morning but it was enough. I only wish there could have been hot water for me to have a shower/bath. I was in Room 334 but had to ask my friends in Room 333 to use their shower.,7
beds are super comfy. excellent location. ,10
Lovely staff very friendly and welcoming and gave us some good tips on where to go. Stayed just the one night but the hotel is in a great location and just around the corner from the market would definitely go back! ,9.2
The location is fantastic. All the staff we spoke with were friendly and helpful No mirror in the room just in the bathroom where its difficult for my wife to use her hair drier. Overly complicated controls on the heating - couldnt adjust the temperature at all. Strangely the toilet seat is set too high ever sat on a toilet with your legs dangling? Its really uncomfortable. Breakfast food was fine standard continental with good bread but the breakfast room used to be a bar area and the staff will insist on doing the washing up behind the bar right next to the customers which is really noisy.  The coffee is terrible stewed and weak.  Youve got to read the label on the vacuum flask to check its coffee as you cant tell from the flavour.,6
Continental breakfast was good. The room had an excellent canal view. The staff were helpful in explaining the area attractions and organising taxis etc. ,10
Got a free upgrade to a river room - really fantastic ,9
The staffs was really friendly. The room was clean. Probably one of the best in town in term of location. The room was a bit smaller than the pictures indicated.,8
Perfect location close to the City centre. Standard room was quiet and comfortable. The view could have been better (facing a wall) but apart from that everything was nice. Breakfast was sufficient and good. Id just mention the rooms view but since we were out for the whole day it didnt matter.,8
The cheap and tasty breakfast! The elevator is small.,7.9
Fantastic location. Very large room and bathroom. Parking arranged through the hotel at a good price. Helpful and friendly staff. The smoke alarm flashes constantly which meant it was hard to sleep in the night. No windows in the rooms due to he design.,8.3
The hotel was very modern the room was clean and the bed itself was very comfortable At the time of our stay the hotel was going under some refurbs although the room was in good condition the value for money was perhaps a little to high,6.7
Perfect locationVery cleanRoom a good sizeSafe in the room which is handyBed very large and very comfortable  ,9.6
The room was spotless clean we didnt really have any natural light in the room. Our friends had a room with a view which was lovely. Our room was very good value and we were put all day. I would chose a room with a view if I was back in Bruges. The location couldnt be better. I would have liked a window with a view.,10
The hotel is placed in a great position close to every sight in the heart of the town without letting the noise intrude it. Very comfortable amazing architecture especially in the breakfast lounge which offered a magical view to the canal. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had in a hotel. Extra credit for the really kind and helpful staff (especially the gentleman in the reception). The glass in the bathtub is not big enough resulting in a lot of water falling out. The room could have been cleaner. I cannot by any means describe it as dirty however there is room for improvement..,9.6
Location.  Our room had the most amazing view! A bit noisy in the evening.,9.6
A wonderful location  parking is only a 5 min walk maximum.  Breakfast was amazing.  ,10
Staff we fabulous. View from bar terrace amazing. Centre of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel. My room was very comfortable with a lovely view and the shower was how I like it. Plenty of hot water. Breakfast could do with more choice although what was in offer was lovely. Reception doesnt open until 8:30 am so caused difficulties checking out early.,10
Very good location Only 1 sachet of coffee 1 teabag 1 water & no milk they didnt give us clean mugs for the second day,7
Room 023 was right above the river and we had a stunning view swans going past were just an arm length away. You really cant beat the hotel location. Breakfast was adequate and team struggled to keep coffee and buffet replenished.  But for the price you cant complain.  I would definitely go back. ,9.6
Had canal view room. Bed was huge and comfortable. Over bath shower in bathroom.  Room had fab view with windows opening right onto canal. Old building full of character and also been modernised. Breakfast usual continental plenty of choice. Plumbing in bathroom gurgled a bit and was a slight smell which went away but to be expected.  Certainly didnt detract and would highly recommend. 2 mins walk to market square and right next to beerwall. Overall would stay here again   Nothing to dislike.,10
Location was fantastic. Close to market square and view from room was beautiful. Room decor was a little dated.,9.2
De locatie is perfect! De kamer was erg klein.,8.3
Good location During our stay room was not cleaned and water coffee and milk not replenished. In addition to this upon return one night front door locked half hour before stated time and night manager refused to open even though I didnt have a key (only one issued for two of us and I returned alone). Night manager refused to come and open it was was miserable,4
Value for money was quite good (only 6 euro at the time of writing) ,9.2
The staff were very good and very attentive with good service. The hotel was in an excellent location. The breakfast was also very good. Reasonably priced parking in a nearby location. More attention to detail in the room i.e. loose toilet seat and bathroom not closing properly.,7
Perfect location great staff comfortable good breakfast. ,10
Fantastic location. Great view from the breakfast room. The room and the bathroom were both spacious and exceptionally clean. I would most definitely stay there again. ,10
So cosy central and helpful. Breakfast could have been a little better.,9.6
Location was perfect The bed was to soft but they cant please everyone but other then that it was very nice,9.2
Location and staff Poor quality towels thin with holes unacceptable. Glass doors on bathroom and toilet. Bathroom poorly ventilated steamed up. Curtains in room off the track,7.1
The upgrades to the facility were excellent.  The staff was extremely helpful in every regard. Streets of course are tight and tough to drop off luggage for folks that cannot walk from the parking garage.  Not a big concern but get all the information on parking at the reservation time.,10
Rooms were clean and bathroom large with bath and shower. Breakfast was in the old part of the hotel and the view overlooking canal was lovely.(which is what we were hoping for when we booked the room! ) location was brilliant for all attractions. Some of the photos of the hotel were in my opinion misleading..the front of the hotel was modern and our room was a white cube the window was blocked with a un openable blind..as it looked onto a wall..very claustrophobic not to see outside..obviously a new part of the hotel.  No wardrobe just a rail with 4 hangers but they gave more when requested.,7.5
Fantastic location everything in walking distance. Comfortabke room nice breakfastParking available  Warm room at night,8.8
Did not have breakfast at location.  My room wasperfect for my stay.  Lady at front desk was very helpful with checkin and helping me with booking a train for next day.  That was so much appreciated. Cant think of anything !,10
Location was excellent staff were nice. Room was modern and very clean. The room was dark no drawers to put small clothes.,9.6
Location was perfect and staff were friendly There was no refrigerator in the room and also no slippers and a minor sewage smell for a few hours ,7.9
Location is perfect just minutes from the square. Beautiful views and friendly staff ,9.6
Excellent location and staff very friendly and helpful. ,10
The room was quite good the location of the  hotel was also good.  So we quite enjoyed our time there. Towels and bed sheets never changed I guess its the only thing.,7.9
Location fantastic staff good fine bed and bathroom. No wardrobe in room just a frame with a couple of clothes hangers. Also a convoluted lighting system got the hang of it after a couple of days!!,8.3
Nice location helpful staff and nice view from the room ,8
Great location just 30 meters from most spectacular bridge in Brugge and 100 meters from main square. Public underground car parking nearby spacious rooms. ,9
Everything. The location the beautiful renovations they have done the incredibly friendly and welcoming staff and did I mention the location??? The air con in the room wasnt great. Needed the windows open all day and night but thats pretty normal for anywhere in Europe really. It wasnt a big issue at all.,10
Great location  looks  good from outside. Reception area very modern rooms no character  cheap pine staircase tatty lift and the corridors to the rooms dreadful. The building is old but they have added no character to this hotel.  The only place thats in keeping is the restaurant which looks over the canal. Should of been cheaper to stay. But location great if thats all you want.  Location,6.7
Location clean simplicity  Needed more staff,8.8
Location  as its just few mins walk to the Belfry tower and restaurants and view Overlooking the river bar was closed at night,10
Hotel room was very nice front of house staff very helpful when our safe wasnt open. Location was perfect and convenient. Breakfast staff I felt were negative to us arriving unhelpful and grumpy this made us not return to have breakfast another day.,7.5
excellent breakfast very clean hotel very friendly staff they even call me before we arrive to ensure i will have the keys after the reception closed . all good,9.2
Location and beer related decor Not much too complain about,8.3
The walls were exceptionally thin and could pretty much follow the conversation of my neighbours on either side of my room. Too much light coming through the gap / curtains Otherwise it was a decent 3-star hotel. Staff very friendly bar was nice. Too bad I couldnt do a tour of the brewery. see above. should be fairly self explanatory,6.7
Nice room friendly staff great food and beer. Loved the beer vending machine. Tasty breakfast! It takes about 10 min to walk to the city center. Easy parking across the street for 5 Euros per dayWould stay here again for sure! Our room was on the 1st floor (no elevator) which was not ideal since we visited with our toddler and had a stroller. Wish we would have been assigned a ground floor room instead. ,8
Creative design and the world famous brewery is at your doorstep Exceptionally inpolite and not so professional staff both at the reception and at the restaurant.Wifi doesnt work in the room only in the restaurant due to poor reception. ,5
Locations was good very close to the city center. Room was nice and clean. There is a inner parking (5 euro per night) or parking in the street in front. Room was very humid!,7.9
Breakfast was reasonable Location was part of the Het Anker Brewary. Rooms were quite poor and very noisy. No power point in the bathroom no shelf in the shower and cheap coffee packets in a glass! Breakfast was reasonable. We had issues (twice) with blown circuit breakers (turned out to be a shorting kettle) and parking boom gate failure. WiFi dropped out regularly,5.4
Atentive service and easy to find location. The Wi-Fi was a little erratic.,9.2
Convenient location close to Railway stationTram station and main attractions. None,8
Brilliant location right across the road from the train station. Easy tram into the old town. Plenty of restaurants around plus a grocery store to purchase snacks. Nice 3-star hotel with everything expected. No do not disturb sign. Cleaner interrupted me while I was sleeping off an illness and they didnt understand English. A flight of stairs up to rooms from the elevator older or impaired travellers would struggle to get their bags into the room.,9.2
Very good location if youre travelling to/from Sint-Peters station and dont want to get into the city. Any other place is easy to reach from here as trams and busses go by the station. Nice view from rooms overlooking the square. I had a room on the street side and didnt find it noisy. Not every staff speaks good English and I found it a bit difficult to communicate on occasion.,9.2
 Air conditioning unit was not there in the room. At least a ceiling fan or a pedastal fan should be kept in the room,7
LocationVery close to Station Gent Sint Pieters The staff is polite and helpful Small and dark room. Very very small bathroom.Bad smell in the room.No air condition.Actually the hotel is a kind of hostel not a hotel. ,4.6
Location quite room Old builing and furniture. Spiders in the bathroom :),8.8
It is very centrally located out of the central station.  Other attractions are about 20-25 minutes away if you are at a leisurely pace.  Alternatively you can take the citys tram into the heart of old town.  The room rate was not incredibly high but it was not quite value for money if facilities provided were only limited and if the room size was just not spacious enough.  Still it is not a bad option especially for your late arrival into the city and early departure from it after the city visit completes. ,7.5
Close to all public transport Staff very accommodating ,8
This hotel is ideally suited for public transport. It was very clean breakfast was good and they got in gluten free bread for us. Very friendly and helpful family run hotel. It is also has a Nepalese restaurant where the food is very good. This restaurant is worth a visit. Excellent 3 star hotel. Nothing,9
Really close to the train station and close enough to the city center. The temperature in the room wasnt as warm as expected once we arrived.,7.5
Better than expected but watch out for the teams outside if you are a light sleeper The trams and the cost which was seemingly relatively reasonable value but still expensive for me,6.7
- Close to the Railway station - Very close to public transport (in front of the hotel) - Very friendly staff - Easy check in/check out - Big parking garage on 4min walk from hotel - Perfect for a short weekend - Small fridge in the hotelroom - A bit noisy you can hear people walking on the hallway - Small breakfast - Small shower - If you cannot walk stairs: after the elevator you have to climb a few steps. - No parking in front of the hotel,7
Friendly staff and quiet night sleep.  Room was comfortable and bright. Decor in hotel was dark and communal areas did smell of curry from the restaurant.,7
Close to the train station was clean and the personal is kind.  The building is a little bit old. The furniture in the rooms should be renewed.,6.3
Friendly stuff good breakfast good location  Wifi is not very fast,9.6
Distance to the place I wanted to go. It is impossible to sleep with all the outside noise trains trams busses cars ..The room had a bad smell which wasnt possible to get rid of even when ventilating.I would never recommend this to anyone.,3.3
Excellent people a great location very close to the train station and to mass transit into the city.   Only ten minutes by bus.  Lovely breakfast. Clean and warm.  I will stay here again if I ever get to return to Ghent. ,10
We stayed at Castel Hotel for 3 nights with my family. The rooms were quite big and decent. Everything was clean with nice view balcony. It takes 15-20 mins to the tourist area. We experienced the most hottest days in Belgium and we expected the hotel shouldve air conditioning service but unfortunately they dont have it. Luckily they provided the fan in every room and with the big windows. Finally we still alive :),7.9
Location No drinking water in the room,7.9
Great location near to Ghent St Peters station very polite and helpful staff clean and comfortable room. The door to my room was very difficult to open.,8
Free parkingAcceptable breakfast  No private bathroom and the shower and toilets on the corridor werent very clean.. one shower with no hot water and the other one with a really short spray..,4.2
Nothing Received apx 35 bits of different bugs also  a lot av them from bedbugs. dirty rooms dirty toilets dirty showers  A nightmare of a place to sleep,3.3
Map location Breakfast Silence and Price. Baths services.. more Towel please.,6.3
Near train station No bus to go center city,8
Very clean. Great shower and toilets. Lovely staff It was hard to find in the industrial estate. Look out for the sign!,9.2
The breakfast was ok To entertain the tourist,5
It was a great experience! The location is great and very near to the city. The personnel is friendly helpful and speaks more languages than you can imagine. The view from the windows was breathtaking. We didnt took any breakfast but we saw it in the vast dining room and it looked and smelled great. A must visit for everyone who travels close to Herstal Liege or Maastricht. We will definitely come again. No toilets in the room. Toilets are cleaned automatically. Robots are not perfect.,10
Nothing Terrible washing facilities hand towel to dry off after shower. When requested bath towel was told the hand towel was only available.,3.3
Need to improve Room too small and sharing of toilet and bathroom,4
location smell of cigarettes communal toilets cleanliness,5.8
Nothing to like here In no way should this establishment be listed as a Hotel it is just about the most basic worker hostel level accomodation and apears to be used solely for single male occupants many of whom would appear to be immigrants . I did not feel at all comfortable to sleep  in this establishment and promptly left to seek an alternative rest stop .,3.8
Reception available 24/7. Clean sheets and towels comfortable bed sink with warm water and mirror in our bedroom was very convenient good value for money. We stayed on the third floor and our wing had two rooms only and was very quiet. Does the job for one night sleep. Good location near the highway and free parking was great! Some toilets/showers were out of order and I imagine the guests that stayed near the toilets were always waking up with the noise flushing.,8.3
Not much Shared and not clean bathrooms and shower,4.2
nothing showers and toilets are outside the bedroom,2.5
Easy to get to from the highway and theres plenty of parking space. Staff very friendly and helpful. You get what you pay for. Its the cheapest accommodation in the area and its fine for an overnight stop.  I wouldnt want to stay longer as it is remote and there are no places to eat nearby.,7.9
Once we actually found it we were comfortable for just one night plus there is now a supermarket over the road We drove through the town looking for the hotel and found it a nightmare it was so busy but if we had more time it would have been nice to look round,7.5
Very basic room in basic hotel - but had everything one needed and guy on reception was helpful. ,5.8
 Not clean. In times of civid19 its a very poor thing!,4
The service was good. Nice people. My room was clean when I arrived The shower and toilets are shared.,5.8
Basic but clean Location is a fair way from Namur.,6.7
Cheap stay and easy parking. Loos could have been cleaned more often!,7.9
 Dirty bed sheets you could say someone used them before and they havent been cleaned. You could smell the sweat. Disgusting!!!,5.4
For one night night price is reasonableSupermarket at 1 min driving Carpet in room are really old and dirty,5
A former Hotel Formule1 which could do with updating.  But ok for a night. Breakfast rather poor even by Hotel Formule1 standards. Hotel not easy to find when coming from Liege on a non-motorway route due to roadworks in the vicinity and very poor signage of how to negotiate them and to find the hotel,7.5
Was ok met our needs You get what you pay for,7.1
Friendly staff low price Dirty curtains dirty tv console dirty shower,6
Price .. nothing to comment  good value That the top bed was only like a .. do it your self plus that  it was only the  duvetwithout cover laying on top,8
It was cheap breakfast good value and the gentleman on the desk as breakfast was lovely. You get what you pay for.  Gentleman on desk when we arrived could have been more attentive sink leaked. ,7.5
ive been going there for the past 5 years ,7.9
 As a non smoker I got a smoking room.The room was so smelly that I woke up with a headache and had to do the lanudry right after I checked out. All my clothes smelt really bad.,7.1
Staff very friendly and helpful Its an old F1 hotel under different ownership. More expensive but nothing extra for the extra cost. OK for a nights stopover which is what I wanted as its very close to the highway,7.5
Quiet We were traveling by motorcycle through the country and it was a good place for an overnight.Shared bathrooms very clean. Separated shared showers very hot water and strong stream. No elevators for the people with heavy luggage or with disabilities.,8
 Its what you would expect for the coast,7.1
location clean no walloutlet to charge your phone in the room.bathroom and toilet is shared in the hallway with all other hotelguests. also no elevator to other floors. Bedroom is clean bed is clean and sleeps fine! ,7.1
The price is better than others Its not good to pay for breakfast. There are few foods and Its not so good.,6.3
Comfort and close proximity to Midi Train Station. ,7.5
We did not like ANYTHING at this hotel This hotel was horrifically  horrid. It was a building site outside and couldnt get to the front door. There was rowdy low company outside the hotel. Inside was something from the 1980s and dirty and smelly and rank. The room was dated and dirty. We had no toilet roll. When we left in the morning the sidewalk was awash with  maggots from the bins. I would definitely recommend NOT staying here. Find somewhere else please.,2.5
The owner of the hotel was very nice and suggested me free parking spots for my car. The location is very closer to the Midi station. The hotel and the rooms are dated and need a serious overhaul. The area is not safe to wander in at the night time.,7.5
Very close to Midi station with easy access to all parts of Brussels. Clean rooms nice staff ideal for 1-2 nights business stay if you are looking for a best value for money solution. Recomended especially if you arrive with a Brussels Shuttle bus from Charleroi Airport. ,8.8
The staff is friendly and kind! The price was high but it was due to the Football game the same day. The staff offered free breakfast :),9.2
It was close to the train station which was the reason we booked it. We thought it quite expensive for what it was. The wifi did not work and the room we had was very noisy.,5.4
Location quite nice decor  The drain in the bathroom needs cleaning - bad smell.,7.9
Very basic place to sleep conveniently close to the station. Slightly dodgy location (although it was only 400 yards from the station we hear fighting as we walked between the two),7
Very friendly management Better to have yard-side rooms because of noise coming from the railwaystation,8.3
I stayed there for less than 8 hours checked-in at midnight and leave at 8:00AM to the airport. I like the location because you can walk there less than 5min from the train station its literally in front of the train station on a big avenue which makes it noisy. But I slept well with earplugs. ,9.6
Staff was friendly. 24h open reception. The lemon smell in the room trying to cover up some kind of smell. The room not being ready upon arrival. Door not being able to close completly and a lot of cold wind being able to pass into the room Finding an empty beer-can on the balcony. A tv but no channels to watch.,5
 Did not feel secure due to conditions of poor door,6.3
Close to the main Station rooms were clean frindly staff The rooms are rather old,6
Excellent location. Staff is absolutely nice helpful and friendly! You should visits the African restaurant 20 m on the right from the entrance. Supermarkets nearby are open on weekends. Having minibar in the room could be good.,9.6
Location very close to Brussels railway station Gare du MIDI and good breakfast. ,8
Excellent location. Good staff and clean hotel. Rooms are very small.,8.8
 Bathroom smelling like if someone had just smoke inside they were doing Renovations to the hotel with drilling machine at 9am on the Sunday. Completely annoying. ,5
The closeness to the railway station. The staff was friendly. It was noisy and the room was not very clean with deteriorated furniture.,6.3
Location was good. Clean enough. Staff was helpfull and  good humored. ,8.8
Friendly comfortable and convenient location but.. The room faced over a busy noisy road. Honking and sirens woke me up several times.,7.1
distance from the station I did not feel save there.,4.2
Clean room and nice staff Old furniture depressing room with inner window bad sound isolation,5.4
Excellent location pricepoint. Helpful staff No Air con Noisy,7.5
 Im sorry but the hotel needs renovation. Painting needs to be restored. The furniture is old and in a deplorable condition. The staff is nice and attentive to the clients.,4.2
Nothing that comes to mind. The general comfort in the hotel is poor.  The rooms are not nice and you look forward to ending your trip.  The facilities are poor.,4.6
Good location right near the Midi station. Decent sized rooms. Basic accommodation. Tired interior fittings. Some rooms better than others.,5.4
It is very close to Gare Midi and there were pedestrian crossings handy for crossing the busy road. There were restaurants nearby too.  The shower was roomy and good.  TV reception was good as was WiFi.  We had a balcony which is nice though the view was of the railway.  The beds were comfy and it was pleasant to have a real double bed not two singles pushed together with a gap in the middle.  There was a lift which was helpful as we were on the fourth floor.  Bedlinen was clean. The outside wall seemed completely inadequate to cut out any traffic noise from the road and specially from the railway. There seemed to be trains all night.,6.7
We picked this mainly because we needed to get a Eurostar train when we checked out. The location wouldnt suit everyone right next to railway.Friendly and helpful staff.When we stayed there was a market just across the road that sold everything and was very large. I am not sure what days it is there (we were there on a Sunday) but well worth a visit. Old town was a fair walk away but that was our preference as we wanted a location near the station. There was some noise outside. Soundproofing not the best.Was a little overpriced for the location and facilities.,6.7
 The bathroom or 103 needed maintenance.The toilet foist was faulty as was the size I tap and bath plug ,4.6
Close the the station Outside the hotel there were some creepy people and they also came inside during my check in. There was no professionalism and felt I am checking in a place srounded by people one can neet feel good.,4.2
Really close to the Brussels Midi train station making an early morning departure a breeze. We arrived a few hours early and were allowed to leave belongings in room (still needed to be cleaned) so we could start exploring without carrying everything. Stayed in twin room. One bed was great while other was less sturdy.,9.2
Good service of the staff The internet did not work properly,7.5
The staff was very friendly and make us feel very welcome. The Hotel is very close to a very well connected station with several lines to travel around the city. ,7
Lovely friendly helpful staff. very close to midi station. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants around It was too noisy and too hot at night,8.8
Great staff very helpful. The location is good. The bed was very confortable and the room was clean. Plenty of restaurants around about 10-15mn by walk. It is closed to the sunday open market. Small bath room.,8.8
I really like the place and we enjoyed with all my family . I will recommend all my family and friends to enjoyed same as we have very enjoyable. They place its very close to they train station.  Thx ,10
Property is good and easy location Staff Co opration,8.8
The hotel is close to the Midi railway station and 15 minutes by foot from the touristic city center. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There was a persistent smell in the room. The window could not be opened and was half broken (anyway it was over a busy road). The wifi did not work (or there was no instructions and it was completely non standard so that the result was the same). The breakfast was minimal with stale bread and ham slices in open air (but coffee and orange juice were OK).,5.4
Location price clean and comfortable Some noise from street hotel is a bit older but in good condition,8.8
 It is very dirty both in the room and in hotel facilities ( stairs). Our windows were to the railway road.  High noise followed us whole nights. We could hardly hear each other in the room while tried to talk. Never had same experience before of such uncomfortability,4.2
From the arrival the experience was above my expectations: the staff offered us for free tea and hot chocolate and looked for rooms that best suited our request. The man at the reception was really kind he gave me all the information I needed really accurately and with no hurry. He was really hospitable. The rooms were clean and with everything we needed even if furniture was a bit dated (my mother fell in love with the curtains!). The location is good: it is a bit far from the centre but well connected using public transport. ,8
Good location for train travellersGood priceSpacious roomBed was ok Room was a bit too warm though the heating was switched off. Noisy area but thats not surprising next to a train station.Old towel in the bathroom that has not been removed. But new ones were also there,7.1
Very comfortable relaxed great price great location nice breakfast with plenty of variety. Would definitely stay again Everything was fine,10
Placement of the hotel. Quiet during the night Insulation around the door of the chamber missing.,8
Friendly reception. Breakfast was very good. WiFi was good. Cleanliness in the room was at the time of my visit not OK. Bedlight not working garbage bin not working. 2nd pillow not fresh at all. First night very calm second night very noisy outside.,4.6
If there ever was a problem. The staff tried its very best to sort it out. I was there during graspop metal meeting. ,10
Staff were helpful room was clean and comfortable breakfast was excellent ,9.6
Clean room nice bed. On the 6th floor there was constantly a hard clicking sound. That becomes from the box near the elevator door. Very irritating..,6
Location is great right in town next to the Police station. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. I was given a very small room to begin with but after I asked for an upgrade was given a suite which was great.,7.5
I liked de comfort of the extra bed for my kid. I missed a good shower our room the shower was not working good we had to wait for hours to fill the bath with a little bit of water with the right temperature inorde to take a shower or a douch. And the breakfast was always the same dish no change.,8.8
The breakfast provided a good choice. The lady at reception was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast area was busy and a little congested based on the small room used for the buffet style bfast and the access to it. The method of cooking boiled eggs was not effective. I put my eggs in for 15 minutes and they were still uncooked after this time and had to be thrown away.,7.5
Lovely choice at breakfast Beds were really comfortable and they were able to provide a travel cot and bedding at very short notice late at night on a saturday. It was much appreciated! We had thought there was parking on site and it was difficult to carry two very tired children at 10pm to the hotel through the town from the main town centre car park. That was a hassle.,8.3
Pleasant check in experience with a nice lady. Nice big refurbished room with view of the sea. We seem to have been put in a room a bit removed from others because we were travelling with a baby so that was nice and made it less stressful for us. Mould on the wall of a recently refurbished room (?). Room difficult to access with a buggy. Very unpleasant staff member at the breakfast. Snapped at my partner for our room number and generally gave off terrible stress and bad energy as she stomped around the restaurant. Also the buffet breakfast area is too cramped.,6.7
once found bearings - convenient location Unmade bed with cleaning cloth on unchanged sheets  Given an alternative room with clean beds Apology given albeit reluctantly Very poor for car parking,6
Breakfast buffet was good and plenty on it. Fresh squeezed orange juice! Once the Hotel is fully booked it gets really crowded in the restaurant for breakfast especially in the buffet section since its not very big. Bed was really comfy. Hotel is clean. ,9.6
Nice bathroom We got given a room that looked onto an internal fire escape.  There was noise from an air con unit all night. A fight outside our bedroom at 3-4am which apparently is okay for hotels! Got passed round 3 staff in the morning when I tried to complain about broken sleep and my daughter being upset by the screaming.  Told to wait over 2 hours for the owner but had to be out of room in 1!  It was awful.  ,3.8
Very good location Durbuy is a small town anyway. The smallest  I did not had any vegetables at breakfast..And no fruits..,7.9
Location was good at the centre Breakfast was good Staff was helpful. Pictures were with Swimming pool but the pool and all facilities was in nearby hotel . But then you have dress up and go to swimming pool and come back. Same was with Breakfast. All the facilities were in different hotel so was bit disappointed. The price paid for the facilities but need to carry bags to enjoy it Didnt like that part.,5.8
The city in which the hotel is located. The entrance of the hotel is a bit cheap no light no reception. The stairs are from wood which makes it noisy. Not a bad hotel at all but the sister hotel where breakfast is served is better.,7.9
The man by the reception was very nice and informative. Could speak English Dutch and French!The breakfast that was included was really good. And the location couldnt be better.  It was a little expensive.,8.3
even during covid regulationsstaff did very good jobshame restaurant wasnt open yet because i had the expierence to had very delicious dinner before.Breakfast was well organised and standby at front on the door because the covid regulations. Well done friendly staff. no comments since staff did a very good job,8
Clean comfortable room. Large bed spacious bathroom. Delicious breakfast. You have to go to another building for breakfast. When I checked in the room the battery was off and it was very cold. It took time before the room became warmer.,8.3
The breakfast was very good The facilities could be better and we often did not find someone to help us. No one speaks english.,7.1
The breakfast was good despite of COVID restrictions. Location excellent. Room good however the door handle was broken. The heating was working however the room was still a bit cold during the night. ,8
The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The breakfast was very nice. The hotel doesnt have staff at the front desk of the reception 24/7 I had to call a number everytime i needed something. The bathroom in the hotelroom was open means without a bathroomdoor. This wasnt mentioned anywhere on the site when i was booking the room.,7
Great location in Durbuy village rooms a good size good breakfast in Hotel Eau de Roche. Rooms were quite basic no tea or coffee facilities limited plug sockets.,7.1
Placed in the city center of Durbuy The room needs some fresh-up. Not in a good state at all. Bathroom new and very nice they should have made up the rest of the room the same way.,6.3
 Tv beeld was perfect maar verbinding was gestoord.,10
We had 2 rooms. One room had a great rainshower the other a rather shabby and outdated bath-shower. The location in the center of Durbuy is great. Good bed. Bathroom in one of the rooms breakfast was good but there was strong chlorine smell in the restaurant area which did not help appetite. Terrace of the room was dirty and full of wasps. Indifferent staff.,6
Good room nicelocation Bad heating in room and long time before warm water,7.1
Great location rooms are big and quiet. No personal reception. Restaurant closed due to COVID no alternative for breakfast no information about takeout or a microwave in a common area to heat up a meal no cutlery. Mattress a bit too soft for my taste.,7
The breakfast was very good The only thing that was like te pictures was the badroom,6
Very big spacious rooms warm atmosphere well heated very good breakfast. Highly recommended value for money :)  No telephone to call the reception if you need something,9
location: right at the center- friendly staff- good fast wifi bedroom doorhandle was loose- dust in corners Bathroom radiator- sinkplug was broken- tv had bad quality until it suddently went off and was broken.,6
Good locationGood breakfast  Rooms where not like the pictures very old and not a comfortable bathroom ,3
Not much Unclean rooms run down no apparent effort to make it nice. ,3
I like from the room thas very clean I even not swim becas other hotel,5.8
Good breakfast and excellent hot chocolate. Good  bed. Smell in the room (like it had not been ventilated since the last two clients). Small room and bathroom very small sink.,4
Very reasonable price comfortable bed great room service friendly staff. Fifteen minutes on foot to the train station Brussels-Midi. There is not so much to complain about. Maybe just that the neighbourhood where the hotel is located is kind of dirty. And a slightly poor wifi.,8
Very friendly staff at the reception was always helping us with our questions concerning events and the best way to get there.  Room was clean and bed okay. The breakfast included was sufficient but monotonous.  The towels were clean but had a strange smell.,7.1
Comfortable bad and good breakfast Temporary connection WiFi in the room,7
15 minutes on foot from Brussel Zuid train station Very clean room & bathroom ,10
Breakfast and patio. Bathroom roof looked as if it needed some maintenance and the room was extremely hot (the fridge radiated heat).,5.8
Warm and cozy. The chairs in the room hard to work.,8
The hotel nice the area nice. Staff was horrible.,5.8
We have been staying at Dolce La Hulpe on a regular basis. Great hotel in a beautiful area. Large free parking space. Pity that due to Covid the bar at reception and sauna were closed. But this is understandable.,9
The environment is beautifull in the middle of woods. Great place for walking. There was some miscommunication but probably due to the corona time we are still in.  The second morning we would have expected our breakfast to be delivered same moment as first day but nothing happened. Eventually they told us that everyday we had to order it at the reception. Nobody informed us of this.,8
Nothing! Room was dirty and had an attack from bedbugs.They didnt do any efforts towards me housekeeping checked the room for bedbugs and couldnt find them? Ridiculous if you know that you cant see those bugs and need to call a specialist to treat it with chemicals.No refunds or suggestions.Food poisoning from what i dont know cause Ive ordered a lot.Really a shame! My daughter had to sleep on the sofa cause they refused to unfold the sofa into a bed. But Ive paid for a 2 bed room. Waist of money!  Everything,1
This is a covid time review so not representative of the usual service I guess. But overall the stay was lovely the room was comfortable the staff were friendly and the swimming pool was very nice. Cant wait to go back when things are returned to some normality to enjoy the restaurant and all other things that were closed because of covid.  Covid Time room service menu is .. drab. But thats excusable and we simply ordered sushi from outside which was lovely. ,9
Free bike rentals were really nice. Rooms were nice and cosy but could do with a refresh. Breakfast was limited due to COVID. The area is really nice for outdoor activities. Breakfast was added at check-out even though it was part of the booking. We had to go back to reception to get this corrected. Rooms felt a little outdated with wall to wall carpet (we prefer wooden floors).,8
swimming pool  breakfast fantastic  environment perfectly  fine bathroom perfectly  fine toilet perfectly fine very old furniture worn out furniture carpet very old curtains not washed dusty stains in the curtains hygiene on top of the bed not polished lampshades not polished lighting in the lampshades not polished windows not cleaned wardrobe doors not polished the handles also not polished when the sun shines on the wardrobe this is very visible . requested baby cot not available in the hotel room.,6
Very nice location next to the forest. We enjoyed the spa too. Great hotel. The breakfast its a bit expensive,10
The area around it Its a bit outdated. And the bedsheets wasnt clean. But most of all its really unclear for a person who stays only for two days what you can or you cant do. Yes its corona time. But I think it will be more clear for everybody if  in the rooms would be a sheet of paper with all the rules.,6
The surrounding forest The beds were not that confortable. I woke up with back pain.You need to reserve before your stay the massages. There were no slot available anymore when we reach the hotel.,6.3
Great location in the middle of the woods. Depending on which room you get you can have a beautiful view on the surrounding forrest. Good food from the restaurant. The hotel is quite old it seems. The pool and the rooms could all use some renovating. We also didnt like the carpet in our room. For a hotel in the middle of the woods where your boots will unavoidably get dirty this is far from ideal. The beds were also subpar especially the small pillows and the sofa bed if you get a room for 4 guests. The food in the restaurant is good but comes in small portions and is just too expensive for what you get.,7
Staff was overall competent and helpful. On our last day leaving the hotel for a connection to our train in Brussels the hotel charged us an exhorbitant fee for a taxi then forgot to place reservation with the taxi company. Fortunate our skillful drive managed to get us to our train in time.  The hotel should inform guests that they are adding a substantial charge for booking a taxi  of course forgetting to call the taxi was unacceptable in any setting,5.8
Location Cold shower and we tried at several moments.Choice for breakfast was very limited you have to pay extra for an egg not even the same amount of croissants per person prepared in the bag at our table.Food for diner was average and small portion. We had to ask 3 times to order desert and after 30 minutes wait we gave up.We were not told that you have to book nearly 2 weeks prior to your arrival spa treatment swimming pool slots were nearly all taken when we did the check-in etc..Its nice location and nice room but really expensive for the service ,6
Excellent quality hotel. Room service and restaurant were excellent too. Many activities to do in and around the hotel. Definitely wanna go again. Nothing. Everything was of good quality,9
Location Breakfast should be definitely improved,9
The architecture. Somewhere in the past (1972) there was a great man (jo borgen) who did a great job. Today we benefit from this savoir faire without acknowledging it and unable to improve on him .. No apparent policy on food waste.Too much AC  too cold in the breakfast restaurant,9.6
A modern hotel and wellness complex situated in the heart of the forest. Very comfortable room and large bed. Ate lunch at the restaurant and found the quality below what we expected and the price above what we expected. We did not eat breakfast there as it also seemed to be rather expensive. We were able to use two e-bikes and discover more of the forest for free which was a big bonus. We decided not to use the swimming pool due to current health risks but it looks great. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit to Brussels. Restaurant rather expensive and not the best quality.,9
Location Poor ventilations too hot in a room,7
I booked for my mother in law and my wife due to the heat wave the air conditioning was perfect and my wife used the pool and walked in the nearby forest. The modernist 1972 architecture was very well respected and would be worth preserving for the future. Only one of the two restaurants was open and due to the coronavirus the breakfast was simplified.,9
the room The welcome was very poor  No where to relax and have a snack  Seemed completely unwelcom as the hotel was full of students and the whole of the restaurant was dedicated to them and we were offered a table the farthest way behind glass We will not return as After travelling for 13 hrs a nice welcome was what we expected.,3
The place is absolutely beautiful Staff wasnt professional and rude,6.7
We enjoyed the restaurant in the hotel and loved the forest walks around the property. A bit unusual to book the pool but this is due to anti Covid measures. Staff was nice and friendly. the room was tidy and had all we needed incl. forest view. Having little kids we really missed a playground or a playroom at the property its certainly has enough space to have one.also the position of a TV in the room wasnt great but we didnt come to watch it anyway),9
Great location spacious rooms with stunning views. Huge hotel but it feels very private and small in the woods. Great breakfast!  Expensive breakfast (23- a person/day) and food in the restaurants. Also a non-alcoholic cocktail for 9- euro I found a bit too much. Spa was fully booked for all of the 3 days of our stay I guess if you want a treatment you need to book ik weeks in advance. ,7.9
Great location in the forest (ideal to disconnect from the city although so conveniently close). Walks in the forest at different times during the year are a real highlight of this hotel. Spa facilities were fine and not overly busy as we avided a Saturday to Sunday  stay. The only two challenges I see with this hotel are: a) the facilities and services are stretched when it is very busy (such as busy pool and busy breakfast restaurant) which can be avoided by going at off peak times and b) the restaurant still struggles to provide good food and good service (especially slow) I now prefer to take the car and visit a restaurant in La Hulpe or Genval for example.,9.6
Location in the middle of the forest Comfortable room and bedSwimming poolNice to have breakfast set up served in room  No conditioner shower cap or body lotion (strange for a 4* property)Breakfast could have better quality products (ex: croissants bread and cheese were quite low quality industrial type),8
Location ia very peaceful Dinner choice was limited,9
The surroundings the room the bathroom. Food at restaurant. Staff. Upgrade program is a rip-off: I upgraded to High-floor and that just means 1st floor :-( The forest-view upgrade gave you a limited view to a garden with some trees but than with buildings at either side. Very difficult to find the number for room-service and once you find it they dont answer. Restaurant is good but expensive.,6
The breakfast was fantastic The evening meal was over cooked and under seasoned the bed was very hard and uncomfortable the pillows were far to lumpy the hotel is extremely corporate and impersonal.,5
Location decor and parking. Staff were resealable you accommodating Keith was good.,7.1
Excellent breakfast and good evening meal. ,8
Charming hotel located in the middle of the lovely town Houffalize. Very nice Christmas decorations and lights. A lot of walks and ATB routes. Nice food served in our room because of corona. We even had a jacuzzi in our spacious bathroom. The shower head was broken but in the end the manager himself came to fix it. The art on the walls was pretty seedy and outdated to be honest please put some new paintings up!,8
Great room - quiet town - breakfast very good ,8.3
Service is excellent rooms very clean inside of the hotel is more then beautiful VERY rich breakfast. There were some small torn on towels and sheets.,9
The room was very well: spacious and clean. Breakfast was very good. No possibility to have dinner in the garden because there was no staff available even it was promised before and the hotel was almost fully booked. Even for take-away dinner the garden could not be used. Take-away pizza was not baked very well and it was not cut into slices. Very little space for the bikes in the laundry room. Both days of our stay we needed to reinstall ourselves the laundry racks and trays to create place.,7
The room was spacious bathtub was good too. Breakfast has generous portions.  We went for the package room + dinner and we found that it was very pricey for what it was. The meal was very basic cantine-like food (smoked salmon and salad as first course pasta and chicken for the main course and a chocolate dessert). The room was nothing close to premium.. There was no boiler or tea/coffee facility. The parking space is also very limited. ,7
Is it true that Booking.com profits from the illegal occupation of Palestine? Is it true that Booking.com profits from the illegal occupation of Palestine?,5
Double bed is too small for two people. Bathroom you cant turn. Least facility hotel. Bed is too small,3.3
Staff was very excellent especially (mohamed and kais ) they are friendly and helpful The location near to metro station  Nothing,9.2
Very good value for money and helping staff No AC but that was fine because wasnt that hot,7
I had a wonderful renovated room in the backyard. The bed was very good. Staff was friendly. Hotel is close to metro station ,9.2
Everything was nice. This is a generale request. Please suggest to hotel restaurant cafe abroad to add decaffeinated coffee and barley coffee for people not having the possibility to drink caffeinated beverages and always include free-sugar foods for people having problem with sugars.,9.2
Wi-Fi good Room quiet as requested Breakfast basic and unexceptional Room and public area was clean but uninviting and colourless. Limited English UK channels and one lamp bulb broken. I was in the annex across the street Fire escape on my floor was via my room - receptionist said not to worry!,6.3
The staff are friendly. It is allowed to take water for drinking from the machine. Water stucked in the shower room.,7.9
Very nice place near citys center  nice and clean room. Warm in November! Tasty breakfast suitable time for it. Wide choice of jams good coffee and cheeses. Helpful personal. Theres no any vegetables at  breakfast. Even tomatos.,10
Great breakfast offered from 6.30am to 9.30am. Friendly staff reliable WiFi and clean rooms. Good shower with shampoo dispenser (same for handsoap). Within walking distance from the central station and shopping mile. The room was quite cold when I checked in because the heating was off. Separate bathroom (I had to leave my room cross the hallway and use my hotel card to enter). That was specific to this particular room though (408). The view from my room was very poor.,8
I really enjoyed my stay here. The room was very comfortable and quiet the staff was always kind and helpful and you could make yourself a nice and healthy breakfast to start your day. I would definitely recommend it. ,10
Nothing The hotel was very dirty. There were stains on the carpet. The bathroom and the room needed remodeling. It was also very noisy.,2.5
Nice place staff Room with no A/C. During the summer impossible to sleep,7.5
Nice surprise. Good location and standard for that value of money. Could be cleaner ,7.5
The room I had was cozy and just right for me. Its simple and clean. It was a walk from and to the central train station. It may take some people 15 minutes but someone who never been there its more then 15 min. Its also quite a bit of a walk to the central plaza. Dragging my luggage on the cobble stone sidewalk was not easy.,8.3
The bathroom was all renovated and very clean although really small.Friendly staff and good breakfast for a fair price. The double room I booked was a bit disappointing because the queen bed (only one) was so small..,7.1
Great comfortable bed and room with balcony was exceptional! Was great overall but there was a smell of cigar when entering the room!,7.9
Just a minute away from many various restaurants a subway station and a tram stop. The room was pretty silent everything worked. Nice selection of bread and grains at breakfast. The single room was pretty basic: no kettle no fridge no storage box. Only two power sockets: youll need to choose between charging your laptop or turning a desk lamp on. Its a bit cold in winter but quite a right amount for me.,8.3
Was really comfy room. They should put air condition for summer and 1 mirrow on the room just one in the toilet,7.9
The hotel was in a perfect position for the purpose I had in Brussels easy to access. The breakfast war just fine. I had troubles with self cooked egs but the rest was just ok. Even though I expected no luxtury the room I stayed in had such a heavy smell that it was difficult to relax.,7.1
Ground floor reception was all veryy satisfactory and a good standard of breakfast I had a poorly presented room which was more like a hostel - over hot and no opportunity to regulate. No material about Brussels in the roomNo water or option too make a tea,6
Nice bedvery good location. Very helpful personnel.  Clean room. No refrigerator in the room. It was a bit cold in the room. Poor breakfast.,7
Good location and good breakfast. Very small rooms and very small bed.,5
Clean and confortable. Fair price. Poor breakfast.,7.9
A very nice and charming Hotel - breakfast was fine rooms were basic but fine. Overall the atmosphere and building is very nice and charming as said As usual prices are high in Brussels during these days,8.8
Well located near metro station Madou good breakfast very clean. My room was newly renovated and the paint was still smelling. When I arrived 9 oclock in the evening in the room was very cold and it warmed very slowly after I opened the heating During the night it was a little bit noisy because the window was to the boulevard.,7.9
 Very noisy and room was not confortable.,3.8
bed. room size for solo traveler. i booked the double bed. ,7
newly renovated. very nice need more mirrors. only one in the bathroom for three people was hard to manage,9.2
Excellent location. Thin walls and street noise.,9.2
 breakfast was very poor. among others there were no eggs,4
Excellent location Comfortable bad Clean room Useless WiFi Thin walls,8.3
Everything especially value for money Nothing,9.2
Staff so friendly and helpful  More accessible mirrors,8.3
Well located in a quite area perfect price/quality ratio for basic accommodation. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Room in need of a little refurbishment. Cleanliness needs to be improved especially in the room itself.,7.5
Excellent location friendly staff. The room was the smallest and most basic hotel room Ive ever stayed in but since I just needed somewhere to put my head down for the couple nights I was okay with it. If I had intended to spend any length of time in the room I think I would have found it too claustrophobic. I didnt get the impression from the website that it would be as small as it was.,7.9
I love the hotel design location and staff. The bed was comfy quiet suitable for a short business stay.  A minibar would be useful.,9.2
Small and basic but very clean. In a nice location for some bars and restaurants The walls were very thin and when I woke in the night I couldnt get back to sleep as the person next door was snoring very loudly!,6
Good location easy to find near a Metro station with easy access to Brusells Midi easy walking distance from Gare Centrale. A pleasant old building with quiet rooms. Breakfast rather unimaginative but for an alternative there are many cafes within easy distance. Tea/coffee facilities in the rooms would be a welcome extra.,8
The location. But is is full of hotels nearby Ill never get there anymore. The fact that I had to stay only one night.  They kept my luggage during the day (as every hotel do). The day manager was polite. Room at the third floor of a dependance across the road incredibly no lift 6 flights like the one in the picture for 130 euros. . Not even a warning of it. Small room. Extremely small shower. Do to a problem of the mixer unusable (only extremely hot water coming out). Get to get out and across the road in order to have breakfast.,1
Location is exellent centre of the city. Five minutes of walking to Central Station. Taste of old part of city.  Staff is very frendly. Breckfast good. Optimal solution value for money. ,7.9
Great value for money for solo travellers. Neat modern rooms 24 h reception bed is comfortable. Maybe rooms lacking some spirit but yet again this is a conference hotel. Tidy and functioning. ,8.8
 Pictures give a different image of the hotel. Not so hygienic. Price can go down not worth the price.,5.8
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good and the staff was again very helpful. The hotel is a little bit noisy but its  an authentic old UNESCO building with art deco elements and a very good art deco cafe you must visite. Next time I book the same hotel Little bit noisyThe matrass of the bed . . ,8
Location Room was dark like a cell. Shower room was tiny  toilet was separate with no whb. Window opened onto a service shaft. If I looked out and up I could see the sky FAR abive. .IT SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS A BEDROOM IN BOOKING COM. I complained and changed rooms after 1 night. 2nd room was normal ok. Also the lift was out if order after one day there are five floors! I was on the 3rd.,6.7
The location is very good in the centre and close to the beach. Its a beautiful art deco building wit a nice breakfast room. The rooms itself have no style and the bathroom of nr. 202 is very old and outdated. No place to put your things in the bathroom and even no place to hang a towel near the washbasin. The breakfast was refilled very slowly:a lot of food was missing.,7.1
Location was excellent for a concert at the Kursaal  Casino and the seafront.  The double rooms on the front looked very nice from what I could see when the cleaner left the door open. After seeing the photos on the website I was disappointed to be given a very budget room overlooking the neighbouring wall  Double bed was comfy but took up 2/3 room I had to rearrange the furniture to avoid tripping over it in the night!  The hotel had an air of faded grandeur about it but this room had faded quicker than most.,7.9
Friendly relaxed central location Room not cleaned very well.,7.1
its i superb location near the beach and the shops and the bars. It is not modern well priced. good breakfast parking,8.3
Friendly staff nice breakfast Toilet was a bit cramped,7.9
Great location wonderful art deco cafe clean. Its all a bit dated and is in need of some renovation. Breakfast is average.,7.1
The room where they serve the breakfast has a very nice atmosphere. The bedrooms are quite modest and bathroom could benifit from renovation. Saturday night we experienced quite some noice from the street. But breakfast in the morning makes everything ok ,7.1
Good mattress Old and not well maintained but all you need is available,5.8
Location. I stayed at the fourth floor and the street noise made me feel like I was just at the corner of the street. No noise reduction at all.,5.8
good breakfast many choices no airco in the rooms,8.3
I first stayed at this hotel about 18 years ago and I was so impressed with its location decor and historic charm that I have visited there almost every year since. ,8
Very nice staff ready to help. Good location easy chek in on the reception till midnight. Everyday cleaning clean bad linen. Very old building the interior needs the renovation. Very old room.,6.7
Location customer service :)! Not elevator,7.9
position size of room - noise until 1 pm from a nearby disco - mosquito due to the owners having left the windows opened in the evening - its modest but thats ok for the price category in that area (considering the discount without the discount it I would have found a better deal in another part of the city),6.3
Location - close to the EU Parliament.The room was big (I had one at the penthouse) and the bed comfortable.  Difficult to carry a bag up and down the stairs. The steps are too small some of them quite shabby.The staircase looks unkempt. The reception and breakfast bar were not open at 7.30 in the morning. I had to eat breakfast in another hotel.  ,6.3
best location near to almost everything adequate facilities really kind stuff - especially the women - clean room ,6.7
Perfect location within commutable & walking distance of all amenities and sights. Foudil welcomed us like long lost friends and couldnt have been more helpful. The room was clean and comfy with a lovely little bathroom. If you have a problem with climbing stairs take note that there is no lift. Other than that there is absolutely nothing to dislike about this establishment.,9.6
Hotel is located near to the train station very good accessible from the airport and near to the EU district. Clean bathroom and bed. Good for short-term stay if you do not stay in the hotel lot of the time. Very friendly staff. I used to stay at cheaper hotels in higher quality and with better facilities. Okay nothing against simplicity and a bit old-fashioned equipment but in this case.I pay just for the location? I missed normal chair for sitting to the table and work perfect was kettle etc. but just with tea..unfortunately without coffee -).,7
Nothing to like would not recommend. Shabby no lift no telephone poor bed linen poor lighting no pop up plug in sink in first room offered (receptionist blamed maid!) poor curtains did not stop street lights paint flaking off wall television too small  and too far away poor breakfast with only milk available being UHT full fat which apart from its unhealthy nature tastes horrible. A thoroughly unpleasant experience. Take breakfast elsewhere.,3.3
TV had BBC and English channels Decor needs attention,6.7
Location was perfect. Firmer bed. Fresh bread for breakfast.,8.3
they hate a water boiler in the room with tea. and its a cozy room ,7.5
 The bed was too soft and the environment very noisy at night although I kept the windows shut.,5.4
good location if you are in Brussels for a short period of time for work. Everything was as expected.,9.6
The room was clean staff were friendly and the location is very close to the centre.  The hotel looks old but it gave me the feeling of living in a little worn down apartment than a hotel. So it was not really a problem for me. There was no cupboard in the room to keep your stuff.,7.9
 Hotel  does offer any breakfest including price. Breakfast is possible to order in price 70 EUR. However from 800am.,7
Location price Noise from the street in the evening curtains didnt close good enough to prevent for the street light to enter the room. There was kettle and some teabags but no coffee.,7.1
Handy location for parliament and surroundings good size room. Decent powerful shower (though there was no holder for it) nice old building with high ceilings and pleasant staff. Maybe dont stay in room 13! Was not the cleanest room mattress did not quite fit the bed furniture and fittings were very worn. curtains very thin and also did not quite cover the window so did not block out the flashing light form the kebab house opposite - this did thankfully stop flashing at about 11pm though this was only on a Tuesday night.,6.3
location was nice in lively neighbourhood relatively close to subway smell of sewerage in the room on the third floor bathroom room could do with proper renovation and modernisation. Very seventies like. Coffee and tea making facilities but no tea of coffee available,6.3
Convenient location for my meeting NOT HOT WATER FOR SHOWER IN THE MORNING!,6.7
N.A. The hotel is a very bad choice given the price they charge and compared to other hotels in the same area. Interior is in bad shape no wardrobe dresser full with towels and no space for own clothes. The bathroom is run down and with broken door and sink. Cheap and carelessly chosen furnishing. No wonder one has to pay in advance before seeing the room. Clear recommendation to stay away!,4.2
Location and all .. its ok with the price .. No lift,8.3
The location The prize no lift old stairs old room and equipment Small and  darken bathroom.,6.7
The staff was friendly. The location is fine. Its about half an hour walk from the main square but well connected with public transportation. The bathroom should be renovated.,7.5
Basically this is a typical previous-century Brussels house in which individuals rooms have been converted to guest rooms. Price/quality is OK and probably one of the most fair in the district (where most hotel guests are not paying their own bills but using European tax money to pay much higher prices for rooms that are not much better). I have stayed in multiple hotels in this districts single nights at the time and this hotel is just fine. What you see in the website description is what you get. And no there is no elevator.. Nothing. Read all the booking.com comments and you have a good idea of what to expect.,7
Staff members are helpful and very nice! Warmly recommended for a short stay. Centrally located. ,10
 I left at 7 AM in the morning and the reception was closed.,9.6
Location price bed room size beautiful high ceiling shower pressure.  The room was beautiful with a comfy bed and excellent location it just seems a bit tired the curtains werent hanging properly and the shower knob fell off. I put it back on and the shower was great. Just the little touches missing. ,8.3
Location was great. Quite basic facilities,6.7
The staff were friendly and the location was good. The building was old and the room and the bed were not comfortable. There was some dust on the walls. There was not hot tap in the washbasin. There was not  elevator and the stairs were not standard.,5.4
Nothing The room was small . Bathroom was a cubicle with a glass door that did not shut properly. The shower basin had black mould and cracked tiles/ grout. No plug in wash basin. Drain filthy. No toilet rolls when we arrived.,4.2
Good value for money. Large rooms. Convenient location. For that price - nothing.,10
Nothing special. Small rooms small bathroom with hardly place to stand near the sink. Shower curtain kept falling down. It was a shabby impression. To expensive for the quality delivered.,3.3
The location is fine. Our plane was delayed for more than two hours so we came after 1 am and the receptionist patiently waited for us. Merci beaucoup Bathroom was rather small and narrow. There was an imitation of door but not the real door.,7.1
The room size was good beds were comfortable. Decent place to stay for the price because that area is expensive The bathroom was a bit old fashioned,7.9
Location is good. The room looked clean at first (I checked in at night and the lights in the room were quite soft) but in the morning the lack of attention to detail became evident. In my specific case there were human hair attached to the walls of the bathroom and pencil drawings on the walls. I dont much care for the container-type bathroom which worked well in itself despite clear signs of wear and tear.,4.6
The location is perfect a lot of places to walk around. The hotel is easy to be found the staff is more than helpful the room was spacious enough for that type of hotels was very clean and the bathroom had everything we needed. looking forward to going again once the covid restrictions are off. nothing to declare :),8
On our first visit in August we were given an upgrade to a wonderfully large room set on split levels which was perfect for an adult with teenager. On our second visit we booked a double/twin room which was also very comfortable with a lovely view of the lake. It would be nice to have access to a kettle so that guests can make themselves a hot drink before bed but apart from this our stay was marvellous. It would be nice to have access to a kettle so that guests can make themselves a hot drink before bed and perhaps some complimentary water as offered by most hotels.,9.2
Excellent location with terrace overlooking the lake. We booked a double room and a triple for a party of 5 (3 adults/2 children) both rooms were a good size with excellent shower. Open shelves so we did not risk leaving anything behind in cupboards. Restaurant was good with a decent childrens menu. Reception guy didnt tell us where the room was. It was room 16 so we walked upstairs to the first floor but those rooms were 20+ so we had to walk back down past the reception desk along a corridor. The guy on reception kept his head down.. Very strange.,8.3
Great location nice personnel perfect view (choose option with the lake view!) Bugs in the room (not a problem but not nice either) not crispy bed linen,8.8
Beautiful view from your room of the lake and forest. Due to covid we had our meals in our room. Food was very good. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was nice and clean. The shower in the bathroom was open so water got everywhere so had a wet floor after we used each time.,8
 Floors in public areas and rooms were not clean.,5.4
The location of the hotel was excellent overlooking the new Park and lake and if you had a room on that side it would have been good Although pets were accepted it seemed that they were not welcome. Pets were not allowed into the restaurant or breakfast room and had it been wet or cold sitting outside would not have been an option. Also we had a room at the front which abutted the car park. As the hotel is not air-conditioned it meant that we had to have the window open Because of the rooms location if people were smoking in the car park the smoke wafted into the room. Although the restaurant was open there were no menus in Reception and you couldnt have a meal unless you booked in Reception,5.8
The location of the hotel is really great next to a lake! The staff is very friendly. Unfortunately we ended up (after the cancelation due to the covid measures) in a standard room instead of the superior one with the lake view but it was definitely nice enough. Plus point dogs allowed ,9
Location is perfect 10$ charge for a dog I think its excessive.. poor breakfast poor room ventilation its just worth the money for the location and staff friendliness,7
The Hotel is located in an old quarry area under re-development for leisure activity. The hotel building is relatively new and in contemporary in style. The area has become more popular as a holiday location for Belgium & Dutch visitors. The hotel is easy to find in Neufchateau a straight forward drive from the motorway exit The breakfast was continental basic - adequate. The restaurant was pricey for its evening meal offer without being of exceptional quality. The reception was unmanned for long periods with slow response to the buzzer alert.,7.5
Quiet room Nice bed Reception took a long time.  Receptionist was busy doing other things other than attending guests,9.6
Great view and delicious food Secure parking for motorbike was just the open car park.,6.3
I honestly cant find anything good to say about this place. We stayed in 7 different hotels on this trip and this was the only one I wished I hadnt book. What a disappointment! This hotel is not fit for purpose dirty loud and unhelpful staff. Also a lovey view of the car park to top things off and people smoking right outside our window all through the night! Not ideal when you have a baby in the room with you. ,2.5
The room and bathroom was verry nice. Bed was so comfortable to sleep-better than we have at home :P  Beautiful localisation and nice view from windows. Breakfast was delicious ! Unfortunately room in some places could be more clean. Under the bed and in some corners were spider webs..and really big ones like nobody looks there. We were with 2 children and i didnt like it,8
There was nothing good about this hotel There were no air conditioner and they call it as a three star hotel !!! I think even 1 star is too much for this place. NEVER GO THERE.,4.6
Location Better CCTV as I was robbed outside,7.9
Room 12 on 4th floor was comfortable. Staff very friendly. Good location between metro Brouckere and Rogier not far from the North station. Nice art deco elements in reception/breakfast area. All was ok just good to know: every guest receives a message a few days before your stay that says Check in is 3 PM while the hotel means check in FROM 3 PM (so only if you want to check in before 3 PM you pay 10 euro extra). Beware there is no elevator in this hotel while it has four floors (rooms 9-12 are on the 4th floor).,7
Nice bar downstairs v friendly and helpful staff.  Only one key to room. Soundproofing from floor to floor not great. Room was v compact.,7
I like the design of the room the area of the room is large. The staff is very friendly and the location near to the station about 15 minutes on foot. The environment and the furniture are good. If there is a dustbin in living room maybe be better. Every time I want throw something I should go to the toilet or the washing room. And if it could be check in early is better. Because somebody usually arrive at noon the check in time of the hotel is 15:00 it be charged if I checkin in advance.,8.8
Its close to the Grand Place. Its really nice to be in the centre of the city. The staff is helpful si the room is clean. -,9.6
Very helpful staff. The hotel has no elevators!!!,9.2
The location and the room was nice. That it has no lift.,6
The location is great it is just in the city center. The staff is friendly and responsive. The linen wasnt clean. After Ive noticed it on reception they changed it. Still the impression is not the best. Also sound isolation was very bad so Ive heard my neighbors.,7
The hotel is ok well situated-closed to the city center  and has a very good breakfast . if you are staying on 5th floor the lack of an elevator is a problem. The girl from the reception desk was not very nice or helpful. As an advice please double check your booking because they will try to trick you and make you pay more for less.,6.3
The best thing was the jacuzzi bath and the bed was nice and bad and very comfortable . The staff were very helpful and friendly. It was so hot in the room it was impossible to be comfortable. The listing of the hotel was very misleading. There was no sauna or gym facilities. It was just rooms above a tavern.  It was very overpriced . Also they run out of towels which is not acceptable when your paying $125 per night!!,6.3
the staff at the reception was very helpful and  kind enough to carry my suitcase up to my room on the 4th floor. ,9
The Staff was really nice and everything was exceptionally clean Location is very central Way too laud in the room.. and the smell of the building was really like old buildings smell,7.5
The hotel is located in the city center close to the main attractions and stations.Bedroom furnitures are quite new. The lift is missing the bathroom small the main entrance needs renovations stairs are extremely narrow and a bit dangerous as well.No kettle for tea/coffee in the room but they provided hot water. Clean Towels were missing twice (in 3 days).,6.3
Friendly staff fast WiFi beautiful breakfast room. Warm with no airco but noisy outside so couldnt open the window.,7.9
Staff were lovely !! The rooms were too hot there was no fan.,5.4
Everything is ok Theres no elevator .and it was difficult to carry the bags,8
Location great. No air conditioner.  When I asked at booking I was told Belgium cool so it was not needed.  Room too warm during day so we avoided staying in the room during the day.  Outside street under repair.  Area noisy.  Handrail painted white was filthy.  We were on fourth floor (our 5th).  Stairs narrow.  Window had broken hinge upper right-hand corner so it did not work properly.  Paper basket would hold maybe a quart-sized bag.  We always had to find a bag or some way to contain trash.  Asked for an extra pillow and it was there when we got back to the room in the evening.,5.8
Great location with very helpful staff.  Room and bath clean and comfortable.  Stairs could be an issue for some but staff very willing to help with bags. ,10
Good location. Friendly staff. Lack of an elevator. Cleanliness should be better.,7.1
Centrally located. Attractions restaurants train station all were nearby at walking distance. They charge us 10 Euro for early checkinn even though rooms were ready.  The hotel doesnt have a elevator,8
Nice staff quiet close to station Payment for extra blanket,7.9
Location is good for bars and restaurants. Didnt have a fridge in the room.,8.3
overall good stay. but noisy in night because of proximity to road and train station. ,7.1
 The write up said that there was an kettle in the room there wasnt,8
Excellent location very helpful and friendly staff There was no fridge in the room. Hearing was not so efficient,9.2
The hotel is located near to the station and here its really comfortable to reach the city center. The staff is really nice and helpful! ,7.1
24 hour reception desk with very friendly and helpful staff.  Room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Close proximity to the Midi train station. The neighbourhood felt unsafe especially for young women walking into the touristy areas. I wouldnt suggest walking out at night in the area around the hotel. ,6.3
Central and comfortable No seat in shower no guidance from staff,7.1
The location was great. Close to the train station and just 10 minutes from the Centre of Brussels. It was advertised as having a bar. When we got back to the hotel we thought wed just have a drink at the bar. Apparently its not been open for 4 years. The air conditioner/heater didnt work properly. The wifi got turned off well before wed checked out. Towels were old. ,6.3
Staff were very competent and helpful. Nice breakfast and good location for taking the Eurostar in the morning. It smelled a bit of smoke in the room although it was a non-smoking room,8
Good value for money good location nice breakfast. Had a room with the view to the main street just in front of the train station. It can be annoying in the morning if you wish to sleep more because it is quite noisy.,8.8
good location. close to main train station and a short walk to the OLD TOWN. very convenient. friendly staff no frills hotel but clean and well run . good breakfast for EU 12.50 per person ,7
 This is a seven floor hotel made of wood the stairs and the floor of the 7th floor are made of wood..Dangerous in case of a fire.,8.3
Excellent location friendly and helpful stsff ,8
Breakfast was OK. Room was large beds comfortable. However.... Bathroom was filthy. Excrement presumably from previous occupant smeared on toilet seat. No soap in bathroom. Asked at reception for these to be rectified nothing was done. Not particularly cheap given the state of the place.,4.2
Only the location Nothing special I have been in lot of places around Europe and I was really disappointed with this hotel it cost lot money and for me the service was very poor ,4.5
Free parking good staff clean rooms. There were no utensils to cook or cups to have coffee. Only few cutlery like spoon forks etc.,8.8
Personel was nice 24 reception wifi worked well. Our room was cleaned everyday which we didnt expect so its a big bonus. Breakfast place was open 24h (without breakfast itself obv but there was a nice big space with tables and chairs where we could spend our time with friends from other rooms). Fridge in the room kitchen in the room. Shower was great with really hot water (if preferred) and great water pressure. In general I would recommend this place.  Localization is medium. Not a lot of shops/restaurants nearby. Relatively close to expo. Lack of air condition which hurts during hot days (we had a fan in out room though). Kitchens items were old/dirty. Breakfast was mediocre. Coffe/tea/juice milk some toasts and cheese. No meat no anything hot except for coffee. ,7.9
location cleaning furniture equipment was wery noisy..etc,5
the matrass good bed Staff not friendly dirty bathroom a lot of noise terrible breakfast (only cheese and jam) terrible bread way to hard.,3.3
nothing at all everything was so sick from the receptionist to the room to the location to the smell in the room everything was horrible I assure you if Im not sleepy and my son slept already in my car ill never stay there even free of charge  guys you have to take this hotel out of your hotels options,2.5
Placed in the very opposite side of the place where I had to meet (but good communicated) the Hotel is in a quiet nice place. People working there are very kind. Facilities are good for the price: clean and comfortable. Thats a thing I dont care for but if you look for a brand-new building with new walls new facilities then this is not the place.  But everything works well so for me it doesnt mind how old is the paint or the shower. I was well there.,8.8
Location is good No carpet dark coloured bathroom n no aircon,6.3
Good location  five minutes away from the public transport ,7.9
Walking distance to the Atomium. The room had some maintenance issues and could do with a spruce up.,5
 -clogged shower drainage and broken shower cabin door also the water in the shower was either too hot or too cold and the pressure was low-stained furniture and curtains-very few plates pans and cutlery and ONLY ONE plate that would fit into the micro oven (the oven plate was missing)-no AC-no proper table and chair for eating although the room had a kitchenette and there was enough space for a table,4.6
Location and accesses to the public transport as well as good and spacey room. It was close to the facilities we visited and the hotel is situated in very calm and secure part of the Brussel Offer for breakfast could be better.,7.5
Its okay for people who want to stay just one night and not spend much. The staff was helpful. You can pay with Bancontact/Maestro (wasnt mentioned on booking.com). The room was pretty dirty. The staff claims to be trilingual but does not speak Dutch. Not recommended for if you want to stay several nights or are on a holiday. Poor breakfast.,5.4
 breakfast too simple. very poor internet,4.5
The bathroom was very nice shower was lovely plus it was clean. The kitchen in the room was very useful but we had no kettle.  The bed was very comfortable but the room was very dated. My window was held together with cello tape and it rained heavily which came in through the window sill. I wouldnt recommend for price.,5
Location is not bad. Parking availability. The room is big enough. Internet connection was good. The receptionist wouldnt let me pay in cash eventhough I had the option paying in cash or use my credit card. I tried to explain but he remained stabborn and doesnt want to listen. Breakfast was almost non existent! Cold tea and coffee no eggs no ham no meat product at all no tea spoon. Shower sprinkler too short (ca. 170m) some bulbs were broken the drain in the bathroom were blocked both the sink and the shower drainage no soap no light in the underground parking the stove didnt work no utensiles in the kitchen cabinate .. I wonder how its possible to award a hotel with two stars when all the above things and more are missing!,4.2
 The room was not ventilated for ages: smell of the room was awful! The bed was really very uncomfortable: 2 mattress each on other and moving to all sides windows opening handle -broken. The furniture of bathroom was broken (MISSING DOORS) many rusts on the walls.  It is needed to take medicine control to take a look if You did not catch diseases from this hotel (nail fungus or etc)!!!!  It was really very POOR hotel and the price do not match such type of room. Shame on hotel staff who can not speak english. I am strongly disapointed with this one booking. IT IS THE WORST HOTEL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!!!!,3.8
Basic accommodation but big room with kitchen and bathroom. Tired decor and bathroom rundown.,7.5
The staff was available 24/7 for access to the building and spoke good English.  It was a nice 20 min walk to Peppermint Square with shops and places to eat. The breakfast was just bread cereal and yogurt with only luke warm coffee.,7.9
Shower water was very hot and it came with a kitchenette It is not modern.  It looks old  shower  microwave cooker heating walls,5
The staff were hardworking and available Shower drain blockedNasty odour in bathroomMain door light Switch faultyTv with no service,5.8
People were friendly Very old bathroom furniture. Dirty chair/headboard,6
Free parking and cleanliness. The building is so old but the hotel is very clean.,6.7
The breakfast was good. The rooms are not properly cleaned. There was dust on the hair dryer the lights in the room. The exhaust fan was covered in layers of dust,7.5
The staff were very friendly and helpful  5 stars for thim. Cleanliness was poor could be improv.,6.7
Room size was good comfortable bed Reception area entrance facility is run-down,7.1
Good staff Clean rooms No elevators  Small refrigator No drinking water Far from city centre,7.1
Just comfortable bed. Cleanliness smelly fridge location stuff need renovation. Would like to come back at all.,4.2
Parking! They have free parking !!! Kitchen in the number - really good surprise =) Good breakfast. It can be cleaner. But price is corresponds to quality =) And bed linens was very clean.,8.8
Nothing and really nothing Very bad hotel actually you cannot say if this hotel is very poor breakfast Very dirty . Very sorry I dont take any pictures . I just want to go out of this please,2.9
The staff were very helpful at every point. The bed was very comfortable. It was possible to bring my own breakfast to the breakfast room and use the microwave there. The croissants at breakfast were fresh and delicious. The location is handy for VUB Jette. The kettle in the room was wired wrongly and not earthed (they replaced it when I complained). No ironing board was available. The breakfast was pretty minimal with not even a choice of fruit tea only tea or coffee. The TV was OK but the reception was a little fuzzy.,8.3
the breakfast was good.  The room was OK but a bit tired especially the bathroom - which needs a bit of a spruce up. Many stains on the chairs in the room.  The reception staff (especially the gentleman on check-in from Afg) were very helpful and polite as where the staff working in the breakfast room better bathroom.,7.5
Nothing special but good enough for one night. Very poor choice of food.,8.3
Clean spacious roomwith lift accesscomfy bed.Lovely continental breakfast with freshly baked coissants.Good locationnot far from mini europe and atomium. ,7.5
It was an excellent place to stay considering price. Good connection if you want to visit Brussels and other cities like Antwerpen. ,7.5
Nice continental breakfast clean apartment and good parking facilities. Nothing,9.2
Very nice location Same breakfast every day,7.5
Hotel staff Curtains musquits shower and shortage of parking spaces (too small amount for hotel size and location).,6.7
The breakfast could be also with meat. The boiled egg is missing. The choice in bread could be more. ,7
Staffs are very polite and helpful Breakfast,6.3
Nothing Very bed hygiene. Bedroom was dirty. There was no warm water. In the morning I call the reception due to the warm water. He came he sow that I didnt have warm water and he went away. Never cane back. I do not recommend this hotel. Any other hotel will be better than this one.!!,2.9
I put the do not disturb sign on the door and was not bothered by room service. I liked that The hotel controlled the heating from the front desk. I did not like that. Room was cold. BUUUUUUR,6
quick check-in and check-out fresh bread for breakfast excellent location broken fridge not working air conditioning only one electrical outlet in a room,7
Breakfast had a good variety considering COVID restrictions. Location was amazing next to the beach and short walk to town. Room needs an update as the fridge didnt work and the towel rack wouldnt turn on. Our bed broke the first night but they sent someone up to fix it.,7
It is clean and breakfast is good It is not a 4 star hotel,7
The staff was nice the location is good just next to the beach The room walls are very thin you can hear everything from the rooms next to you the windows are not soundproofed we couldnt sleep from 5 in the morning from the noises (seagulls cars people etc) the breakfast was really bad,7
Great location lovely swimming pool quiet room with very good amenities good breakfast buffet. Wifi quality and choice of TV channels very good. Big comfortable bed.  The bathroom could do with some freshening up in particular the bathtub. Dont like that I could not open the windows to freshen up air in the room. There is good ventilation but still want to be able to open one window. ,7.9
The situation was really close to the beach. The bathroom was not clean the support for the shower was not stable. There were  few stains on the pillows ceiling (probably somebody smashed a bug or something) sheets.The took mesures to organize the breakfast time because of the covid-19. Its sad that the tables were not cleaned. People at to sit on tables with leftovers from the previous clients. We were lucky enough to find the last clean spot.,6
Nice staff swimming pool nice when not too crowded Beds are quite uncomfortable as well as pillows,6
Location Swimming pool is really small they put bedrooms above the  swimming pool so if you start to laugh and speak the staff will come and tell you to be quiet. The mattresses are not that comfortable. The airco works really slow. The breakfast was not much more than cereal bread and yoghurt. Just basics. Not worth the 4 stars. The staff was polite tho!!,7.1
Lovely pool very nice staff and food service in these corona times was excellent and very good food too! 5 min walk to the beach.  Too much noise from the street and it started very early in the morning a lot of traffic including a film recording. Not great when you come for a relaxation holiday. Wifi a bit shaky.,8.3
Location is excellent.  In the city center and few steps from beach promenade harbour and main  shopping area. Rooms are comfortable although a bit smaller but spacious enough for shorter stay. It was cleaned every day with daily challenge of towels and few times a week change of bad sheets and covers. Polite and helpful staff. Excellent offer of bread for breakfast and very good coffee.  Wifi and internet access was very bad and almost impossible to connect. It is a pity for rather nice hotel in city center. Offer for breakfast could have been better.  There should be more variation and restaurant should have been bigger.,8
breakfast was good The shower in the bathroom missed a rod to hang the shower head.,7
 I couldnt sleep during the two nights I was at the hotel due to the strong smell of humidity (room 225),6
I like how close it is to the beach. The room was ok the sauna was nice too. The breakfast eggs were cold and the chocolate cookies were baked too hard.,7
Good location great room ideal for three people with sofa bed friendly helpful staff Nothingt,10
Clean and quiet hotel very close to the sea-shore. Room is ok in size comfortable bed. The shower/bathroom in general was a bit dated and could use some renovation.,8
The staff was very kind and nice and the position is perfect. The beds are confortable and the breakfast good ,8
Location very strategic and loved the swim . Beach and walking at 1 minute . Restaurants at 1 minute . Friendly staff . Plastic for shampoo and plastic for butter mermelade etc  ..but that is nearly each hotel on the planet in the past let us hope that !,8
Just around the corner from the boulevard and beach. Quiet rooms requested so we had a view of other buildings - we did not mind that. Indoor pool was good to unwind on a rainy day after sightseeing. The room cleaning service was a bit haphazard but all was rectified by reception staff who were very helpful,7.9
pool - breakfast no wifi reception in room - could not be settled additional bed for kid was hard room was humid noisy ally,4
 Milk was not like you would get in the uk,10
This is very convenient localisation near many bus lines and walking distance to tram line.  Surprisingly little noise from the street WIFI is not easy to access.  Rooms are quite old.,6.3
Distance to airport allows late night check in. Dirty falling apart exposed and non functional outlets worse than a motel.,4.6
The staff was nice and friendly the rooms were clean breakfast was ok. The whole property SCREAMS for renovation everything is a bit TIRED there.,6
wi fi was fine staff was very cooperative traffic outside,7.5
Breakfast was very good - excellent coffee especially ,7
Nice clean room witch extra bed and pillows Too cold no thermostat in the room either,5
Hotel is outside the Brussels and will take atleast 20-25 minutes by taxi to get to city ,5
Th location is outside the city centre but  there is reasonably good public transport around. The breakfast is continental type but suffiecient to energise you for the day. The re is 24 hours receptin and the staff is helpful. The building and rooms are old and need (cry for) renovation. However it is reasonably clean.,6.3
Staff excellent - room ok all clean - no issues.  Good price for area ,7
Friendly staff both in the reception and breakfast area. Nearby to two bus stops and Lidl. Quiet area.  Good bed - with a hard mattress. Room was otherwise functional it had all I needed. Very good value for money. Poor breakfast - very basic continental. The building is very old and needs renewal and some maintenance.  Noice from traffic outside.,7.5
accommodation in quiet area very close to bus station  15-20 min to centre by bus kind stuff (she printed us flight tickets without problem) we slept in last floor many steps.. room little bit stale old equipment but there was lot of space and it was clean,7.9
The location was perfect for my early morning business meeting. I could have an early breakfast as well (even before 7am). Some other guests seemed to have a meeting in the middle of the night. The room was tidy but basic.,6.7
Nearby was a bus stop. The room was noisy and no ventilation. There was no hot breakfast.,6.3
Nice bed - though with hard mattress in case that matters to you. Room was otherwise functional it had all I needed. Also nice calm and green neighbourhood. The walls are very thin you can hear very well when people are walking in the corridors and when opening/closing doors.,7.5
kind reception steep staircase up to the second floor difficult when carrying a suitcase poor status of the shower cabin full of mold (see picture) breakfast with limited choices no fresh products no banger e. g. salami no available parking lots (as told in the description),6.3
honestly i did not like the breakfast. the breakfast,7.5
 The property has not been refurbished in a long long time. The curtains were completely ripped and in general it did not feel safe.,3
Breakfast was not inspiring but nothing is during COVID time. Arrived late and the night duty manager was very pleasant and helpful offering me a larger room without me eve  asking for it. He also suggested I put my car in their parking space that evening as access could be difficult in the morning.  Room was freshly decorated and exceedingly clean. Decor including bathroom is extremely dated. Lack of  air conditioning wasnt a problem for me but it could be for some guests. Steep stairs with no elevator to all floors.,6
Smile of the receptionists :-) Big room. The breakfast was simple but very good. It was rather cold in the room. I was unable to use the table in the room because TV was on it.,6
Pretty clean Very cold heating was really low at least on my room ground floor. Probably better during hot summers. ,5
The proximity to my clients offices. Thats all. Breakfast was very basic continental. The carpets were awful. The permanent green welcome carpet outside the hotel puts you off immediately - completely torn and looking dreadful. Interior carpets were equally poor.,5.4
Good location in an upmarket area north of the city center. Acceptable accomodation at a cheap price. Still decent value for money. Very basic and worn down. Simple rooms and hard bed. Very basic breakfast.,6.3
Room was clean and shower was good. In general was OKNot specific great thing however one good thing is 24/7 reception  It doesnt have elevators  careful if you have very heavy / large luggage The location wasnt very good at all. I booked this place only because its closer to the airport but in the morning I cancelled the Uber as it would take 18 minutes for the car just to arrive and pick me up. I asked hotel to call a taxi  theirs took 15 minutes to reach and finally 41 euros yo charge. Between city and this place using public transport meant too many changes or too much walking ,5.4
Good transport system enough close to airport near is Lidl so i could buy for nice price salat for dinner.  In the evening of the first day there was no hot water. I booked this hotel 3 weeks before my work trip and paid 204 euros per night so i expected more than just cold water. Last year i also stayed in 2 stars hotel payed less money but everthing was perfect. ,7.5
The breakfast was alright. Staff was alright. Shower and toilet were broken and barely usable. Room was too hot no AC. Most of the fasilities need renovation.,5
Stuff at reception helpful and friendly. Room smelled like someone smoked there before. Shower stucked water didnt flash away,6
The cheapest in Brussels The guy at the reception wasnt polite. The furniture at rooms are old and broken.,5
The personal The building is very old and ned remodelation and some mantainecence.,7.5
The location was superb. Breakfast was good. Toilet/Shower room was a bit on the small side. The shower head needed to be cleaned because of the build up of limescale affecting the shower performance. Eating out was pricey.,7.9
Comfy bed small but practicle room. Overlooking the main square only 150 meters from Museams and the Menin Gate. Public parling outside in the square is inexpensive. Nothing really it was a good inexpensive hotel in a prime location.,7.9
The hotel was right in the centre. Ideal place to stay to see Ypres. No problem getting parking within 200metres which was free on Sundays. Breakfast very good.n N/a,10
Great location. Hotel a little dated but great character. Really good breakfast included. Kettle in the room a good addition. Owner always present at breakfast and really attentive. Staff on arrival not v welcoming although think he was restaurant staff not hotel. He didnt even tell us where breakfast was served or mention the serving hours. Room served in a little tricky to find we werent the only ones who didnt nearly find it,8.8
Location was great (right on Ypres central square) free parking in the square (1800-0900) lots of pleasant restaurants in immediate area excellent base for exploring nearby WWI battlefields.  (The battlefields are well set-up for exploring by bike or extended hiking - highly recommended.) Both hotel and rooms are quite small (okay for 2 people) manager was not always available,6.7
A lovely big room with nice personal touches like sweets on each bed. Breakfast was really nice with  pley of choice. The place was right on the main square near to everything in the centre and plenty of places to eat. Parking isnt difficult either. Recommended Very little ventilation in room but it was unseasonably hot weather. You would need fans or Aircon if staying for more than a night.,9.2
Nothing It was dirty uncomfortable not as listed and the staff were unhelpful and disinterested-all In all it was awful with an unsafe atmosphere.,3.3
Breakfast was good but building very tired not safe for little ones !! Bannisters on landings were far to low & very unsafe,3.8
Great LocationHelpful staffClean. The room was slightly on small side.,10
Excellent location on town market square of Ypres. Simple but comfortable room with elevator access. On-premises reasonably good restaurant and cosy bar. Friendly owner giving plenty of useful information. Free parking at about half a mile free night parking right in front of the establishment add two euros parking fee at five pm and you are ready up to after tomorrows breakfast. Nothing comes to  mind.,8.3
Breakfast was good. Staff friendly. Location was excellent. Good free wifi. The signage outside the hotel could be clearer just to make it easier to locate when driving by. But thats a very minor point in a very good stay.,7.9
The location on the square was greatThe staff were great even got our room ready 4 hours earlier than our check in time. The prices in the square were very high,8.8
Room was basic but clean. Breakfast basic and hot food selection poor. Hotel needs better front signage.,7.1
We liked the location of the hotel right by the main Square Nothing,7.1
Excellent breakfast and fantastic location. ,7.9
Location Very small bathroom and shower. Bed was uncomfortable and the hotel smelled of smoke,6.7
The location was great and friendly staff ,8.8
 Small rooms and dated tired decor but great location for all the sights.,5.8
Breakfast had a wide variety . Clean Beds were not made up on arrival we had a very long trip and arrived late to find we had to make the beds ourselves.  not enough milk provided. We did not see any staff apart from one gentleman at breakfast. A little in personal ,7.9
The location was amazing- overlooking the main square. The evening restaurant menu was absolutely beautiful. The food was superb. The rooms are a little run down but for location for one night this wasnt an issue.,7.9
Perfect location in main square easy parking good clean room and first rate breakfast. Reception a bit haphazard.  I had to leave my key on the desk when I left as there was nobody there to give me a receipt.  But maybe that was unusual.,8
Friendliness and helpfulness of staff. Hotel location was superb for my needs. Breakfast sufficient for my needs. Enjoyed dinner on two evenings. For the price nothing.,9.2
Location was excellent for Menin Gate and the centre of Ypres. Restaurant and breakfast were very good  The room was a little tired and could do with a spruce up,7.5
Excellent location. Good public parking available close at hand and at reasonable cost. Good breakfast. Ensuite facilities very cramped. Decoration was very tired.,6.7
Very easy to book in and book out.  Great food and friendly staff.  Top location in the centre of Ypres. ,9.2
Great position. Comfortable bed. Tiny bathroom with poor ventilation.  Interiors need overhaul. Very basic. A lick of paint does not do the job.,5.8
On the main square close to the Menin Gate and Museums Seemed that the restaurant was much more important than the Hotel to the owners. No one about at breakfast time but food was ok all self service.,7.1
Location & Breakfast we spent little time in the hotel and ate out. The room was adequate and clean but very compact anything carried out in the bathroom needed careful planning except a face wash and teeth cleaning! A 3 night stay became a bit waring.,7.5
Good breakfast. great location right in central Ypres. Room and bathroom pretty basic.,8.3
Central location Needs a good facelift! Room was tatty whole hotel tatty.,5.4
A great location on the corner of the Market Square. The self-service breakfasts are good bacon/eggs fruit/yogurt ham/cheese & smoked salmon. There is a restaurant for evening meals - great for carnivores. There are numerous bars and restaurants within easy walking and the Cloth Hall and the Menin Gate are both very close. Squeaky floors and noisy plumbing can get in the way of a long nights sleep. Rooms are small but adequate.,7.1
Good Continental Breakfast Great location OK price. Room assigned was on the road (with road noise) even thought the hotel had very few guests. The wall are very thin. I could hear the guy next door snoring.,7.9
Location! Comfortable bed nice warm room and decent breakfast Bathroom was cramped and a bit shabby,7.9
Central location and lovely breakfast Pillows,6.3
Great location which is why we have used this hotel on several occasions also the staff are really friendly & helpful plenty of breakfast & the rooms are more than adequate ,9.2
Very comfortable bed (executive room)  nice bathroom. Brilliant location. Pretty breakfast room. Very clean hotel. If I had paid full price for the room I would have been disappointed. For a luxury room its very small. The bed very low yet it was surprisingly comfortable. Tea and coffee was in the room a bottle of water would have been a nice addition.  Reception staff a little unfriendly and not very welcoming. Breakfast is budget standard. Canned fruit salad fresh fruit bowl but fruit not so fresh looking. No coffee machine but big thermos coffee flasks mini canned sausages. It filled a hole but was nothing to talk about.,7.1
The breakfast starts on time and the food was good. I didnt see any space for smoking. Thats not fair for people who smoke.,7.9
The breakfast was included but due to an early appointment I did not take it. The breakfast room looked nice conveniently located and nicely furbished. The room was small and a bit outdated but that is expected for this location. There was no minibar and no water in the room. There was no airconditioning. There was a LOT of noise during the night. From other visitors in the hall and in their rooms. I could hear whole conversations and their wake up call.,7.5
The location is perfect and we had view on the sea. The rooms look old and especially the bathroom. Since we couldnt have breakfast etc they could at least offer a bottle of water or so.,6
The Location The Bar was miserable during my stay I was the only person who used it!,8.3
Excellent location. Friendly staff Bathroom with bathtub shower hard to use without getting a lumbago. The very small  and particular bathtub with its non convential shape was completely clugged up.  The sliding door to the bathroom was tranparent. Not a room for elderly and would be convenient as a single room. Pictures on your site gave an impression of a much larger room . . .,6.7
Overall clean good breakfast. Good value for money but not amazing. The lift was broken the first day not great when you have health issue.  Also altough its not the hotels fault the guests were noisy and you could hear a lot of noise when you were in your bedroom.,5.8
Perfect location in city center very close to the beach. Room was small but functional. Enough storage space for clothes. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was OK. I do not understand why they did not put in a shower instead of a bath in the mini-sized bathroom. It was the smallest bathroom I ever had in a hotel room. A shower curtain would also be a solution. We heard the elevator the whole time because our room on the top floor (room 77) was next to the elevator. The food (ham cheese salami etc) was not in a cooled counter at breakfast.,7.1
 very small and hot room. Tiny bathroom glass door - see through! View of fire escape.,5.8
 Please better pillows and disconnect the central heater during the nights,7
Location fantastic - 100 metres from beach and bar district.  Got a very good price in early July.  Single rooms at the back small and a bit dark but perfectly OK for the price and cleaned as soon as we went out.   All-night shop right next door.  Tram stop just around corner.  A little old-fashioned but we like that.  Luggage room for leaving your bags before check-in or after check-out. No tea/coffee making facilities in room. Breakfast downstairs is expensive. Shower could do with an upgrade.,7
Good location. Old style plushness. Unfriendly staff. Room dark and musty. Probably due to the Bordeaux walls that turned the small room rather claustrophobic.,6.3
Nothing in particular  Was average Breakfast okay but no espresso coffee Room was okay but had no character Bathroom no walk in shower Limited bathroom amenities Nothing in particular There is better value for money out there,5.8
Bed extra comfortable.  Wonderful sea view. We didnt have balcony,7.5
Great location.  Room size was large. Very dated run down and not clean.   After 3 months of being closed hotel was not ready to open.  Price was very reasonable though.  ,3
The breakfasts were great and the location could not have been better. Also the fact it had bike hire with a discount for residents was good as we hired bikes for 2 full days out of our 5 day break. Lovely hotel lovely holiday! ,10
Right in the centre of town beside the Markt. Cardboard cups in room.,9.2
Very close to the markt and belfort. You can see the Belfort in your room! If you want to travel Brugge based on the Makrt this hotel would be great choice for you.  You are supposed to hear ring bell from Belfort. Its not annoying but sometimes.. you may be surprised.,10
Friendly helpful staff great location just in the center. ,8.3
Great location!!!! very helpful staff !! ,8.3
Great location and value for money Windows opened onto the terrace,6
Perfect location helpful staff clean and tidy room good price. The small room wasnt small it was enough for 3 people we love it :) Nothing,9.6
Excellent location. Decor dated dark and dingy. En-suite bathroom was what can only be described as a pod with an 8 inch step to get into it!,5.4
The location was great. I did not like anything in this place except for the location. The staff was not too helpful the room was very small the bathroom was really bad. I dont recommend this place to anyone.,5
Location near main square Breakfast very expensive,7.5
big huge comfortable family room with kitchen in the city center a bit shabby,8
 Dirty old room with bad mattress and stains all over.  Do not recommend it to anyone.  Rude employees.  A business made to take your money and offer the worst possible experience.  Big problems with the room.  Very dirty overall.  Avoid at all cost.,2
Location was great The TV is a long way from the bed and is a small TV so pointless where it is. Bath is a little dirty.,5
The area is okay. Room was small no airco and way too expensive for the quality. Even though we booked for 3 persons their was only 2 sets of towels. ,4.6
The bed was super comfortable and the hotel was in a fab location!! The walls were paper thin so was noisy from the room next to me but nothing too bad,8.3
The reception was super niceIts right in the city center and we had great views ,10
position no idea where to park Although kettle supplied no wall sockets worked. no charging of phones laptop was possible appeared to be mid update.  The bed was comfortable to sleep but as only one chair bed was too soft to sit on. we had to stay 2 nights as we had app with a vet for dog,4.6
Nice clean place easy location and reasonable rates. Great for family on a budget or couple on 2-3 days stop over I luv the hotel but the booking.com website is not very clear so I advise people look on site then contact hotel direct.,8.3
Friendly welcome and room size. Perfect location. ,9.6
Proximity to all important sites Rundown and poorly maintained room,5
The location is perfect. In the city center. The bed is horrible. Not confortable.,5
The location right next to Markt is great. On arrival the room was not ready at the advertised time and I was made to feel I was an inconvenience by the reception staff.  I was even told that I couldnt expect the room to be ready for that time when the previous occupant checked out only an hour earlier.  The hotel need to be clearer with their timings online.,7.1
Its location to all things Beds too soft and pillows too hard,7.9
Absolutely nothing! Ants crawling all over the beds. Mold in bathroom corners. Dirty shower curtain. Clogged slow bathroom sink.  Dirty towels dirt & blood stains on them,2.5
I loved the location its really perfect for exploring the city. The only thing I wish I had in my room was some shower gel/shampoo.Everything else was great! ,9.2
The room provided the space we needed for our group of four and it was very close to many attractions.  The breakfast that was included in the price was excellent! There were a lot of stairs to climb with heavy luggage and the bathroom situation was unique in that the toilet was separate from the bathroom and it didnt have a sink so you were required to go into the master bedroom every time you needed to wash your hands.,8.3
We liked the closed proximity to city center but thats all this hotel has going for it. Do not stay here! Unless your young without children and plan drink and party all night long. This hotel sits on top of a pub and its the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at in Europe. Yelling and screaming until 3am every night. The hotel itself is old and rundown. Our bathroom shower was in a different room than the toilet.,1
Comfortable clean and good location The bed,8.3
The location is one of the best in the city just some meters from the Markt square. The room was good but a bit small for 3 person in the other hand the small terrace was great for our dog and take relax moments on it. It has one small kitchen just to prepare basic food but good enough. The size of the room was too small for 2 beds and 3 persons the noise of the bar just down of our room was also uncomfortable.,8
Excellent location!!! Great restaurant on the property and decent breakfast. Incredibly small room and bathroom with a very uncomfortable sinking bed. No real mattress! Main room lighting didnt work so it was very dark.,6.3
Good location The rooms arent very spacey and somewhat old,7.1
The size of the quadruple suite was good for us plenty of space and facility to make food in the suite. Washing up liquid provided (as rule is to wash all crockery becore leaving) shower was powerful. Location is AMAZING! Staff were all friendly and helpful. The large bed was just 2 beds pushed together but not secured and they kept moving apart- sleep was not comfortable because of this. The room requires a bit of freshening up of the decor the room is clean but looks a little grubby. Breakfast was basic but OK,7.1
Location cannot be beat..breakfast was wonderful!!!! Bit dated,7.1
Great location. Very uncomfortable beds giving us extremely aching backs and trouble getting to sleep. Thin walls making it very noisy. ,7.5
Central character. Breakfast room and food. Very accommodating.  Please turn bed around in room 403. Easily done and will avoid banged heads!!!!PLEASE upgrade hairdryers!!!,9.2
 The clean and the staff lack of professionality. The building is old and with a terrible smell. Very good position to visit the. city,3.8
Beautiful hotel old fashioned looks but modern comforts. I stayed with a group of friends and had plenty of room. We were very pleased with the breakfast and staff. Would absolutely stay there again! ,10
The location in the center of the city. De geur. Geen (goed)ventilatiesysteem.Dirty carpet and very uncomfortable toilet/douche.Was also not really in the building but on the ground floor in a pasaje (hal) where almost everyone could walk by. ,5
Dated but nice with friendly staff and awesome location ! ,9.2
The location The room was to small even the bathroom door could not be opened because of a bed. The elevator was for only one or two persons at a time with no luggage. The staff was not friendly at all.,5.8
Good locationFriendly staffWill come back again in the future ,9.6
Fantastic location and an interesting old building. We didnt like the small tired looking room and the uncomfortable bed and pillows.,6.7
Great location. Friendly staff. Good food next door ,10
Great location excellent value for money fab breakfast  ,10
There was not much I didnt like for the price it was a good quality bed and if there is an issue it will be fixed asap ,10
The cleaning was ok the hotel is cheap and you are in the inner city. The breakfast is nice. The bell tower is directly beside the hotel so there is never silence. Furthermore the walls are so thin that even without the bells theres never silence. You can here everything you neighbor does. The cleaning hours are really weird between 15-16 oclock. Thats when I normally want to do little break at the hotel why do they not clean in the morning? The bed is very uncomfortable because its too soft. The restaurant is very expensive but very bad. The doors were really weird I was never sure if they were locked.,5.8
location The bed was terrible very soft and aligned to one side two small beds put together I hardly got any sleep.,5
The location to the Markt square and the sites was terrific. The bar below the room was noisy into the late hours so it was hard to sleep between the jet lag and noise.,8.3
 Furniture old breakfast limited in choice for non meat eaters and even though advertised as being till 11am nothing is replenished nothing fresh so if you want fruit bring your own. Room a bit dark.,7.1
Location Small awful room really bad shower blockReally thin walls noisyHuge spider in the eating areaDisappointing overall conditon,4.6
Best location friendly staff beutyfull garden inside. Coffe and Tea free.  ,10
location is perfect. easy to go everywhere. you can easily hear the noise from the outside..,7
Location was incredible for the price. Adjacent to the Market Square. Couldnt get any better for the price. Great value! We never had to drive anywhere to see anything in town. We stayed there for 3 nights and the staff never came in to clean the room or replenish supplies (toilet paper etc.). Not the fanciest hotel in Bruges but we werent planning on spending a lot of time in the room.,7
Location was fine. 1 filthy (not cleaned properly and bodyhair on the bathroom)2 terrible beds3 someone smoked in the room4 extremely noisy (could hear the actual words of people in the next room)5 window was cracked so a severe draught ,1
The location was excellent and main monuments were within very short walking distance. The breakfast was quite good and rich. The room was quite small and a bit hard to accommodate a big suitcase. I was not particularly happy with some of the staff at the reception as I received a condescending attitude when my credit card did not work (basically being reprimanded for not putting the correct password which was not the case). Also cleaning could be improved as twice the cleaning staff entered the room but did not clean the bathroom and did not replace the shampoo/shower gel.,6.3
The location was excellent mostly the hotel was lovely and quiet. Most staff were welcoming. Our room was not cleaned one day one room was very loud in the night and when I mentioned this to staff they contradicted me so that was a bit embarrassing.,5.8
Absolutely nothing We are experienced travelers on motorcycles and have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over Europe this past 30years some not so good but mostly all are good. But this place was deceiving at first sight and at reception all looked good. But thats where it ended. The hall way to the lift was filthy the lift was just as bad and the narrow corridor to the room was littered with cleaners trolleys which we thought was a good thing haha no such luck. The room its self must have been there since Noahs ark and maintained by Bob the builder. Oh and to get to the breakfast area was a challenge get lift to lower floor negotiate a twisty corridor then get another lift to acces the dining area.  Now theres another story for another day.,5
The most important thing: it was clean. The room the bed the toilet and bathroom24h reception very friendlyThe location is unbeatable!  The Beds were uncomfortable and very short there was a breakfast but without vegetables or fruits - think they could level up their breakfast (especially during Christmas where the prices are higher in general),7.9
The location was excellent very close to the market next to the belfort. It is a budget hotel so its a little bit basic but it had everything I needed. Small kitchen a bath and a nice bed! When I first came in the room was very clean. The staff was very friendly I came to check in and I was offered a room with a kitchen as my original one didnt have one. The small tv was a nice addition only few channels and often bad signal. Other than that I cant say anything bad. Met the expectations of a budget holiday basic but you get everything you need!,10
The location is incredible. The closest you can get to the hot spots in Bruges. I didnt like that the booking.com site claimed there was a big last minute discount while in the end it was simply the regular rate for a very mediocre room. There was some dishonesty here.,6.7
Excellent location. Great value for money. The man at the reception was very friendly informative and helpful.10/10 ,10
The room was clean wifi was strong bed was comfortable and I didnt hear much of the outside world even with window open. Its slightly off main tourism so it helped  Not much to say the accommodations were great,10
Great location. Friendly staff. Quirky layout. Good breakfast. Bed a little soft. No other complaints!!,9.6
Location is good The room had bed bugs.,3.8
The location of the hotel is superb its just behind the belfry tower and every attraction is within walking distance. The room is more spacious than I expected and it includes a small kitchen microwave and fridge which is very convenient. The staff are friendly and the hotel is very flexible with check-in and check-out hours. Overall great value for money  The kitchen light in our room would occasionally turn off and on again after a while. The mattress and pillows can be better,8
The quaintness of the hotel and close to the centre of bruge. Spare pillows in the cupboard looked like they hadnt had clean pillow cases on so couldnt use them. Pillows most uncomfortable.,6.3
 Room smelt musty bathroom sink smelt of sewage bar at the rear noisy till 3am double bed was two singles pushed together so slumped in the middle Wifi was very hit and miss if it was working and room was covered in dust also found hair in the bed. All round worst hotel experience Ive ever had. ,3.8
Nice staff. In the heart of the city. Insanely smaller than expected. Paper thin walls. Bare minimum accommodations. All things Im ordinarily fine with but this was proved the same as other hotels in the area that seemed to have much more generous accommodations. Im sure it was priced this was because of the location but I could have used a heads up. I would have stayed a few blocks away for the same price In an actual room.,5.4
Great location in terms of being near all the best of Bruge attractions ,9.2
The breakfast is basic but very nice the location is centrally located within walking distance to all major attractions & its right next to the Belfort of Bruges. Couldnt complain because everything is up to our expectation for what we have paid for.,9.2
The location is fantastic!  The rooms are small but efficient.  It was clean and the staff is extremely friendly.  The staff could not be nicer.   The breakfast was typical.   The only two issues we had was that the bar next door was very loud very late but we turned on music and slept well.  And the shower curtain was too small and water leaked all over the floor.   We had a car and parked not far away for 8 euros. Needed better shower curtain.,9.2
 It was a really noisy hotel. You could hear all your neighbors (next to you above and below you). There was a dirty shower curtain in the bathroom. Our sheets were dirty. The breakfast was really disappointing too.,3
Great location but parking some distance away as the hotel doesnt have any. Rooms are Billy basic but for ¬£55 cant complain due to the location. If I was spending more time in Bruges I woul definitely look for a better hotrl Room extreme small and bathroom facilities very compact,6
Bikes are easy discounted for staying. Porch balcony was cool.  I dont know why people say location. Its near the square for sure but also by a loud/busy street. Staff was super unhelpful. Bathrooms were also pretty objectively bad. ,4.6
Not a lot Workers banging away past 9 p.m. Very poor mattress springs at edge of mattress so far gone I fell out of bed. Breakfast supposed to be available from 7.30 a.m. but kitchen staff did not arrive until 7.30 a.m.,3
Location could not have been better. We were right next to the Belfry.  The staff were approachable and friendly. Breakfast was lovely buffet style . The hotel is slightly dated . Appliances in or room were old fashioned but usable ,8.8
Breakfast was okay location was fantastic. Breakfast,7.9
The only plus was that it was close to the market square 1. The rooms were not as seen in pictures .2. The reception staff was not polite at all 3. Very very small room ,3.8
Big room. Big breakfast.location. No kitchen towels the fridge had a smell no pots and pans for the kitchen stove and oven.,8
The location of the hotel was absolutely fantastic. No matter where we were going we ended up running into it as it was so central. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and our bed was actually a double and not two twins put together. We didnt have the breakfast but there are plenty of places around for that. I must admit that I was a bit scared when I booked it because I saw some reviews mentioning that it was rather disappointing but my experience was that it was a great choice. There was a delay with the check-in process but they provide a space for luggage which allowed us to walk around and discover the city while they got it sorted out.,9.2
 Room smelled badly. Inclined wall right on top of the beds head. No blinds on the window and the curtains were very thin so the sun went through. No sound isolation - could hear everything from the outside and hallways/other rooms.,5
Great location beside bars & restaurants & just off the main square. Effective blackout curtains. ,9.6
Central nearby restaurants and shop I could hear the neighbours having sex talking in the hallways. Different photos for each room would be a bonus.,9
Location Family rooms only accessible via narrow stairs-impossible with a babypram TV did not work,6
The property was close to the location. Room is never hoovered or cleaned. I asked several time to clean and change my bedsheet towel. The owner send an email after 2 days saying he will charge for broken lamp which is impossible that I broke it and it was next to the window which no one will use.  Please do not pay by CARD the owner will charge the money he wants without any authority.  IT IS LIKE HOSTEL.,4.2
The skylight view of the Belfort was amazing ,10
Nice place. Clean and comfortable. Small tv. Breakfast should be better.,7.5
Very close to Markt Square and easy to access touristic locations The room was on the ground floor it is dark inside and also cold since the room does not get any sunshine inside at all. It is also very small room could hardly fit inside with 2 luggages. We spent one night so did not make it problem but if you plan to stay a couple of days in Brugge I would definetly not  recommend this hotel. ,5.8
Great location comfy bed clean Nothing,8.8
central position.  Friendly staff.  Breakfast ok.  Comfortable bed and bathroom with everything you need.  Highly recommended for those who want to visit Brugge without stress. ,7
location Would never recommend this place. Dull and scruffy. Shower curtain too long in tray but too narrow to reach walls. Hence bathroom floor floods. You would not want to walk in bedroom with bare feet. The whole place is depressing and will spoil your visit to a lovely city.,6.9
Location The apartment type room no.321 was a  grubby old 1970s style place with stained  bedside lamps that you couldnt plug in dirty old painted furniturestained carpetsno sink to wash your hands in the wcno wc in the bathrooma blocked up wall with a dirty old kitchenette behind italtogether awfulthe one thing it had going for it was its location.,4.6
It was next to the Grote Markt! Excellent location! ,10
Location and staff was excellent The property is older and a bit run down.,8.8
The property a little aged but the rooms were clean and neat the location excellent and friendly staff. Nothing not to like,8
We had a room with a small terrace and the location was excellent. Too much furniture in the room for its size made it difficult to move around.,9
 To much noise at night because the restaurant Or pub downstairs.,6.3
The bed was comfortable.  The breakfast was standard.  The location was great and really close to everything! The rooms were out dated.  The toilet was separate from the washing facilities so you had to walk through the entire apartment to wash your hands. This might be standard for the area so this may be a moot point.   Our hair dryer was broken and when I asked to have it fixed they told me to go to the lobby to borrow one they had at the front desk.  No one bothered to fix it.  The lobby was locked at breakfast time and I didnt have my key before I was to leave for work (left it in my room for my family).  Wouldve been nice to be informed of this upon check in.,5.8
We loved the location room and option to have breakfast. The staff was really friendly and spoke English to assist my friend who doesnt speak Dutch. The room was clean and the terrace is a great area to enjoy some fresh air. ,9
Location Nothing the place was perfect.,10
Breakfast and Location 1. The extremely soft bed 2. The answer from the staff to my question on the  small list of television channels. I asked if it would be possible to help my old father in his room to see another channel. The proposal from the staff: please use a tablet or mobile instead. How could my father possibly use a tablet or mobile?? 3. The sewage smell in the corridor 4. We asked for a small extension for the checkout time. The regular checkout time was 12:00. We thought the staff member allowed us to extend it to twelve fifty (12:50). Obviously at 12:50 we understood the staff member kindly accorded us an extension of only 15 (fifteen) minutes. Very generous considering the room price of 200 Euro/night,5.8
Good bed and breakfast well positioned for town centre Not a long enough visit,9.2
After I checked in I saw two bed bugs in the bed. I told the staff and they changed the room for me. It was good that they immediately deal with the situation. The next day the staff told me they have contacted the company to deal with the bed begs. The first room I stayed there were two bed bugs in the bed.,7
Location very central.  Bed bugs!!!! The poor person who got the room after me!,5.8
The location is great. Very central.We had our dog with which is allowed for 12$/night  It is a very old building which is ok but it is super expensive for what you get. We paid 180$ for 2 for 1 night without breakfast included. We didnt sleep well at all because the walls are super thin and you can hear everything through them. The room is also very very small and the mattress is super soft.,5
The location was perfect. staff are not very welcomed they actually just doing their jobs the reception not outstanding i can say and the bed bugs it was like nightmare they bite me ,5.8
Its a good place to stay with family All good,10
Amazing location. Very good value for money. Friendly owners. Was a bit noisy at night.,8
Staff very helpful perfect located. Some guests were smoking inside the Hotel. Bathroom not that clean. Breakfast at the room due to Covid19 which we know. But no variety,7
Loved walking around. Loved all the little shops especially the chocolate shops.  I will visit again. ,8.3
Amazing location and its in the middle of the town. Excellent breakfast Bed is too soft.,9
Breakfast was very good with a lot of bread and croissants and cheese and ham and fruit Nothing,10
I was a bit sceptical about both the hotel and the Brugge Xmas market! Unfortunately both had received several negative reviews on another site. Personally both hotel and market were great. Hotel was not 5 star and didnt purport to be. It was clean comfortable and in a great location. No hesitation in recommending. market was an Xmas market and delivered on that. Lots of shopping in surrounding streets. If you love beer and chocolate book today! ,9.2
 The family room was pretty small and not worth the value.,7
The Hotel is located just around the corner from the market square. Great to explore the city. Breakfast is served in the basement. The space ist poorly lightened not very clean dishes not tidy. The breakfast buffet has only small variety and no fresh fruit is offered. Very disappointing and not worth the money.,5.8
Staff and location where excellent Room was tiny you could walk round the bed,5.4
The staff is super super nice and helpfull. The bed is very confortable The hotel needs some serious updating looks ,8
Location was great and so was the room Breakfast was awful. Some staff lovely and some very grumpy.,7.1
Near market square right in the middle of everything.  Could see the Belfry and hear it good. Great big windows. Great internet access and an elevator The beds were not as comfy as I would want almost fall on the ground 4-5 times while turning.  The bathroom was small and I felt that the toilet was coming off the wall when I sat on it. The carpet was old and presented stains. There was an odour in the room.,6.3
Location location location. Super friendly team at reception The shower was tricky to use shower head in the middle of the bath instead of the top water destroyed the bathroom and your back to the curtain. It was easier just to remove the head and use it manually. ,8.8
Great position. Very comfy bed. Excellent breakfast in atmospheric old cellar. There were a few wrinkles such as a broken lock on the door - we had to change room twice for a two night stay!,7.9
The location was phenomenal! Absolutely cant beat this location! This is the perfect location for a visit to Bruges! The place needs a little work there were cracks on the floor of the shower etc. The bathroom could have been cleaned better. For example the sink was plugged and was full of water when we arrived. Overall though the hotel was clean and comfortable.  ,8.8
The location was excellent in the center next to the big markt. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was good. Overall good experience at this hotel  There was a very bright emergency exit sign inside the room that was lit up all night it was a bit annoying but manageable! ,9.6
Location is the best feature. Hotel room tends to be noisy due to other guests talking and smoking in the top floor terrace in late Night hours. Breakfast is ok constraints due to COVID regulations understandable.ventialtion and air conditioning in rooms can be improved. Ventilation and shower facilities can be imlroved,5
Was fine Not so many people to attend you,5.8
Large room an large bathroom with 2 good restaurants not far away. ,9.2
The property has several different rooms some are fine others are very poor and outdated. The room I stayed in last was very poor and very outdated (70s style). A small hole in the bath tub I did not fit under the shower as the sealing was too low a shower in the bath tub without shower curtain making the bathroom wet and a very poor toilet which made a lot of noise.,5
Very helpful staff. Good food free parking small room,8
extensive choice with evntual extras served with a smno negative experiencesile ,9.6
 Rooms are old and wind is coming throug the windows,5
nothing The greetingThe room.The Breakfast.The fact we was charged more than quoted by Booking .com. Room more like a cheap B&B in the UK and not clean and on the main road into Brussels very noisy,2.9
- Its not a business hotel. It was more my error for not doing due diligence on the property. Rather than the property simply not been up to standard..,3.3
I never recommend  anyone to the hotel  because is a hotel  for Pakistan family residential and not a hotel. Very noises during the night  Also they dont respect clients I think as booking. Com you are just receiving commission  but you dont  value the property before  accepting the hotel  and thats what I  discovered,2.5
 Payed twice for the booking.Barely could understand each other.,5
Virtually nothing.  It was available at a very busy time in Brussels. The receptionist was friendly on arrival and departure. This property barely deserves the single star rating.  Check the area out before booking to ascertain if it is acceptable for you. Vastly overpriced for what it is,2.9
Notting The hotel was too dirty and smelling disgusting!The stuff was not professional.Some guys were hanging around at lobbylooking terrible.The lift was smelling Our bed was old and the bathroom was dirty.,2.5
very clean staff courteous and helpful a bit expensive tv not working.,6.7
I had my own room with my own toilet. The bed was in terrible condition. It sagged so badly that I had to grab the side to pull myself up out of the hole cavern in the middle. The toilet was not very clean the shower drain was stopped and the water pooled up to my ankles.,3.8
Staff was very friendly and they all seemed to be a family. Got a free coffee at check-out. Conditions are extremely poor everywhere in the hotel. Not clean at all. Noise at night.,4.6
Nice breakfast with excellent croissants Kitchen closed too early in the evening,8.8
Location very nice and it was quirky . It is much more run down than in the photos it is very tired  worn carpets etc . Needs a lot of money spending in it . We were misled by the pictures they must be very old. Totally not value for money. We paid 95 Euros and it was no where near that standard. ,5.4
Nice big breakfast. The staff is very helpfull. Grat location situated on the edge of the town at a walking distance to the centre and duper market.  There is a private parking place but no ev charging. If you drive an electric vehicle be aware if this. The owner iffered to call another place to charge the car but this was not necessary.,7.9
Very nice rooms and beautiful views over the city. Good breakfast. Unfortunately the bar closes at 20.30,8
The  view from the window was superb Tierd looking and a touch cluttered,5
The view from the room was amazing and the hygiene in the ensuite was really good. Decoration of the breakfast area was a lot/slightly outdated and the extend of available savory foods was minimum. Nevertheless it was a relaxing start of the day.,7.5
Quirky Hotel with spectacular views across the town. Old hunting lodge style decoration. It set our holiday off to a great start. ,8.8
The room was big The room was dirty the carpet the sofa and armchairs were stained.The windows were really dirty and not soundproof. I could not sleep because of loud music coming from the street.Water was not complimentary at was available at 4 euros a bottle The internet did not work.,5.8
We were given a very warm welcome upon arrival! It was our first time in Brussels. We had a lot questions. The staff at Hotel Le Chatelain were always happy to help. They booked our transportation to places recommended restaurants shopping areas attractions etc. Anything we needed they were there to help. We highly recommend it! You have to see it to believe it!. ,10
Wonderful location. Beautiful decor in the lobby and bedrooms. Really a delightful stay. ,9.6
The hotel rooms staff and location is excellent  The breakfast is not great value very expensive for what offered I went out to have a coffee in the bakery near by with more options of fresh bread and half price Anyway will stay again in the hotel as there is lot of restaurant and coffeeshops and facilities around,10
the parking was very nice its costs $30- a night. its a nice hotel but for 5 stars i expected a bit more. also the breakfast was very medium coffee was brewed so no fresh beans i like think a breakfast with a baked egg always makes my day this they did not have. we also had dinner there this was oke.  nextime i will get another hotel. regards Pieter,7
The staff at the reception very friendly and helpful Breakfast terrible,5
 Upon check-in they took a deposit in the amount of the cost of living.  The carpeting in the corridors is stained. The view from the window on the wall of the neighboring building. The bathroom is very small.  Draining in the bath does not work.  To drain the water the cork had to be picked out with a knife.  Far to the center.  We went by tram or taxi.  It is unlikely to be back in this hotel.,6.3
Good location. Clean. Friendly staff. Its not 5 stars value. When I arrived the room was at 17 degrees. It took a while before getting to a decent temperature. The hotel would require some refurbishment to maintain 5 stars status.,7.1
Reception staff qualification differs by shift. Location is fairly not far from the center. Rooms are sort of stuck in 90-s and thats not a vintage. First room we get was smelly so we asked for change. We have to ask to clean the bathroom from black mold in the other.,5
The staff are absolutely wonderful charming helpful and kind thoughtful to their guests needs and only too willing to provide. Comfortable well-equipped room and spotlessly clean. Thoroughly recommend this hotel! Nothing I didnt appreciate.,10
The staff is friendly and very efficient. The hotel offers great quality for a reasonable price. Breakfast is very good. There was no light above my bath which made it impossible to read while enjoying the bath.,9
Price of the breakfast  29 euros  1 person is all to expensive ! The room was not cleaned in a decent way blankets were no changed even though they were dirty after the first night. Toilet papper I had to ask for more half bottle of water in the fridge at my arrival.,6.3
Staff !! There is no SPA There were no free mineral water in the room this is a small gest with bid impact. All the 4 and 5 stars ive in the world offer bottle of mineral water (still & sparkling).,8
The location is in the lovely area of Ixelles. We had an executive room which was pricey but spacious.  The beds were large and really comfortable!   We were there on New Years Eve but didnt want to be in the centre of things so this was perfect. ,9
It is located in a very easy and nice location to find. The room was alright bed was comfortable. The bathroom was pre-set to a warm temperature to which we could not set warm or cold. It was leaking and was not so clean. It was a bit smelly.,6.3
Nothing. The bed was not comfortable.Towels were not clean.The walls between the rooms are very thin you can hear next room snoring.The staf was smoking while I had my breakfast.I had to ask for coffee by brakfast.,3.3
Its a budget hotel so not too much to shout about. There is a great Belgian Beer bar across the road. The Palais du Biere. Car parking was fairly easy. The bar below was a bit worrying but it was quiet by the time to went to bed.,6.3
Breakfast. Cheap Very noisy at night with people coming and going and making lots of noise. Toilet with no leg room to sit on it properly. Hot but to open the window meant even more noise.,6.3
The hotel room was clean. There was cigarette smoke all over the hotel though no smoking labels were everywhere. The only opening window could not be properly closed. But at the same time it was not possible to ventilate because the fried air smelled from the outside. It was not possible to regulate the water temperature in the shower sometimes warm sometimes cold. The bed was uncomfortable and at night the sighing of the couple from the next room woke us up. The room had few electrical sockets.,4.2
The location of the hotel is nice - in the city center and close to the train station. The room was nice and clean. The hotel stuff members were always helpful - there was no problem when I asked them to order a taxi for me even though my French is not fluent. According to the booking it should be a triple room but it was not. As I was traveling alone it was not bothering me but it would be nice to get such an information about change in advance.,8
The erotic picture on the wall was interesting Dont stay here unless you enjoy listening to friendly young women conduct their business at all hours.,4.2
Location Room had not been cleaned Condom wrappers in the bin.,6.3
 I cannot join the hotel from 2 weeks on their official phone. I need an invoice for a extension that we made but no one is answering.,4
It served a purpose our flight was delayed landing and we needed somewhere to sleep for a few hours. As Im used to going into licensed outlets due to my job and socially it didnt put me out but someone with a nervous disposition but be a tad nervous walking into the bar/reception area felt rather unfriendly even at 2.45 am in the morning.,5.8
Good location. The staff was friendly. The room was clean. ,9.6
Hotel Nightmare - Wil never ever go there again and would advise All others to stay away. Everything,2.9
 The room is small and old. The hotel doesnt have elevator. The staff changed me from one to another and moved all my stuff without telling me. I left for work and when I came back I entered into my room and my things were not there. They told me they changed my room and moved all my stuff. This is unacceptable! And also I was still able to enter the old room that had someone else already. I tried to complain but no one there speaks another language if not French (which I can speak a little bit but cant argue). So I sent an email when I left to tell them my disappointment and didnt even get a reply with an apology.,3
Breakfast awfull Everything for improving hopeless hotel,1
Location Service excellent great beds Bathroom too small,9.2
friendly and relax staff. Location is extremly close to the sea. This is personel but I did not sleep well on the boxspring. I do prefer a latex matress.,8.3
The location of the hotel was perfect. I find wall to wall carpets a little pit oldfashioned and dusty. I would appreciate a fridge in a room.,7
The staff was very friendly despite the restrictions related to COVID 19. The rooms met our expectations: they were spacious and very clean. The breakfast was tasty and it was nice to be able to take a breakfast outside in the sun. I needed one single paper copied and scanned and it was too bad that the staff did not aloud me to do so. I understand that the hotel is no copy center but it was just a very small request to avoid me the extra hassle of having to drive to a distant copy shop.,8
A nice hotel very close to the beach and to the centre of Knokke.  We got a clean and comfortable room.  They arranged us an early breakfast (and breakfast is good) which we appreciated.  Corona prevention measures were respected scrupulously. The bathroom was a bit small and some parts of the hotel look as if they could use a renovation.,8
Great location spacious room lovely lounge with good choice of breakfast There was no plug for the bath,9.2
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect close to the beach and the station.  We also had plenty of space in our room for two adults and one child. The toilet had an unpleasant odor that kept us up at night.  There was also a bright light from the street that shone in our windows until about 23.00.  Finally the breakfast was very basic compared to the other places we stayed during the week.,6
Beautiful beautiful garden great place for photos. Free parking on site. Spacious room. Carpet shows stain. Didnt feel comfortable for my kids to sit on carpet.,8
Great location. Only 35 min by foot to Bruges city. Room was spacious and clean. Nice and friendly staff There was a slightly smell of cigarette in my room. Not big deal at all as I opened the windows for some fresh air,9.6
The outside of the building was beautiful. The drain in the bathroom sink and shower barley drained. I dont like showering in a pool of water. There were cobwebs and mold in the bathroom.  There was a lot of dust behind the room  door and the main staircase was full of dirt. It looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in a while. The place is in need of an overhaul. There were only 2 pillows on the bed and my husband needs two. Couldnt find anyone to give us another. There wasnt one in the closet. Would only give it 3 stars.,3.8
Lovely location and a very lovely garden at rear No coffee or tea facilities in room and very long when theres a function going on down stairs,7.1
The location is amazing. The historical palace and the park are just great. Just 10 minutes by car from Bruges city centre. We booked a suite but The room was awful. The carpet was full of stains and it was stinking. I am allergic to dust so you can imagine how bad it was for me. The furniture in the room was very old fashioned and cheap. The only thing nice about the room was the view on the park. Advice to hotel Management: please renovate the rooms ! You have an amazing location but it is a pity if people have great expectations and then the rooms are blowing everything off. Also the breakfast was poor and with low quality food. The staff was non-existent. We only saw a couple of people in the breakfast room but for the rest the reception was always empty. ,6
Lovely stay nice people and well located! ,8.8
The room is charmant with the gorgeous view. Its very tidy. The room had a lodge where with cup of coffee in the morning you may find peace and serenity. Close by to the city center (10 min by car) the other bonus from hotel is a free parking on a side. The breakfast was quite fine and even I find it a bit limited in options you still find what to eat.,8
The breakfast was very good. Excellent fresh croissants and bread rolls. Only one croissant each provided though :-( ,10
Beautiful building and gardens Funny smell in the corridor on the first floor- do not know what it was but not pleasant! 2nd floor room very hot. A shame that the restaurant was closed during our stay we were not aware of the event they had on. Bar we only managed to get a drink by chance. Would be good to have complimentary water in rooms and tea and coffee making facilities.,9
Good room service was excellent. Safe in room. Tea making in room would be nice,9
Not far from the centre of Bruges. Service and breakfast were excellent and our dog was welcomed. We were able to walk her around the pretty lake behind the hotel.  We hope to stay here again At first we were a little worried as we had not realised that the front of the hotel lay beside a busy road but there was no traffic noise.   Our room was a little snug - but perfectly adequate for a single night stay.,8
 What I realise now is that this hotel is mostly a daytime venue with rooms available. I hadnt fully realised that when booking. There are very few facilities on site.  No clearly obvious reception and after 6pm its not manned. Restaurant/Bar was closed in the evening we stayed. No tea and coffee facilities available in room. We returned after a day out in Bruges at around 9pm to find the accommodation in total darkness which we found very unnerving. We were clearly one of only a few occupied rooms that evening a really disconcerting overnight stay. Couldnt comment on the available breakfast as we did not have it.,4.6
A beautiful property with a truly stunning garden. Very good Wifi connection and easy parking. The location is just a short drive from the city centre and a perfect base for exploration of the city. Very friendly staff and a dog friendly hotel. You do not pay extra for your dog and breakfast is included so the price of our stay was in fact very reasonable and we highly recommend this hotel and certainly would be happy to teturn in future. ,9.5
Weve been several times however this time the room was dusty also there are no facilities in the room if you needed a cold or hot drink. ,5.5
Beautiful castle with a breathtaking garden and lake. The bath cabin can have some shell for the toiletries.,10
This was a great value for the money. It was considerably less expensive than staying in historic Bruges and had free parking. You definitely need a car to go to the historic center - but the cost of parking was nothing compared to the cost savings.  Breakfast was traditional continental and there is a lot of room to sit outside and enjoy (good for kids who need to burn off energy!) ,9.6
The food was really good served warm in the room at a perfect pace The rooms for families are on the side of the road there wasnt much traffic due to the curfew but the views to the domaine were much nicer. pity we could not be on that side,7
Backyard Garden & water lake was beautiful scenic & lively although kids playing area was unused & not cleaning from long time Breakfast & bar counter area was too good & mirrors next to stairs was also awesome Bathroom & bed comfort,9
Breakfast view and grounds Lumpy mattress lack of staff and when present unhelpful bar closed throughout stay (when stated open?),4.2
We stayed with kids for one night and had a relaxing time. The facility is outside the busy Centrum but accessible by bicycle car or even walk about 4kms. Clean and well maintained rooms. The rooms can have a few cutlery considering these are Covid times with no restaurants and depend on take away. The staff was not available at 18.00 for support on cutlery.,8
The atmosphere and the nature view from our suit Sometime you can hear people walking up the stairs and through the corridor. But its OK if you are staying in an old castle.,7
Great free breakfast heating amazing  beautiful gardens wonderful decoration reasonable pricing.  Loved  it ,9
Great place lovely grounds. Very relaxing and great staff Expensive but worth it. Short 15 Mon taxi to town,9.2
Castle feeling beautiful garden worth a small walk agreed to serve breakfast earlyer. Cold water shower in the morning baby crying at night.,6
The room was huge.  Two queen beds and a large renovated washroom.  the grounds were vast with a nice sitting areas out back and a fountain with some walking trails.  A unique location that was a pleasure to stay in The bar closed early 7pm and there was not a restaurant on site for dinner,7.5
The grounds if the hotel are beautiful Small and bit very clean room,4.6
Very small room and small bed for two persons didnt get the value for money. Bed wasnt comfortable at all and small to fit two persons. Room size and facilities over all,4.2
The grounds The bed was uneven tatty bathroom poor breakfast choice plus dirty crockery. Nobody around past midnight and I needed some boiled water! The manager wasnt interested in my comments!,3.3
Friendly staff good breakfast good location Uncomfortable room bad matrass a lot of traffick noise really hot en stuffy and unable to open the window because of the noise. 3 nights without sleep as a consequence.,6.3
Very close to the centerNice looking palace with a lake and garden just behing it :) ,9
The staff were incredibly kind warm and helpful. The property itself is breathtaking. The room was spotless and very comfortable. ,10
A beautiful hotel so close to main town and carpark. Room was really nice but floor creaked a bit but what can you expect with an older building. Staff ok a good morning and a welcome would be nice as never stated in the area before. Breakfast was delicious the fresh bread and Brie outstanding. Room was at the front no traffic noise when window shut but our room was just as you cane up the stairs and was woke a few times from noisy people. The other thing there was no kettle or tea and coffee in the room and you know us English like a cup of tea. Would still stay here again but nit at top of stairs.,7.9
friendly satff When we got back at 8pm no staff available. So not able to have   a drink in the bar. No tea or coffee or drink machine so no drinks at all,5.8
Good value for money nice atmosphere in the hotel nice view from the room (we had a room viewing the garden).  There could have been more variety in the breakfast. The floors were wooden and this caused some noise whenever someone passed in front of our room.,8.8
Food is good. Staff is friendly. Beautiful view. If travel by car its nearby old city center. Old blanket and towels with holes,7.1
Excellent location and a cosy and nice restaurant ,9.2
Free parkingBig room Good location Stock of towel and bedlinnen was located in our room so quite disturbing to be asked to let in the cleaning lady during morning. Breakfast lady not very welcoming.,6.3
Lovely hotel right by the canal. Spacious room with a lounge area. Very clean and beds were very comfortable. No kettle in the room but thats bring picky !!,10
Roomrestaurant and surrounding. Too much quiet :-),10
 Unhelpful staff unwilling to assist with Taxi bookings. Food was good quality but above average price so not value for money. ,4.2
Clean spacious room friendly staff with good English good choice of food (no English version of menu tho) Room was hot no air conditioning or fan (it was constantly over 30 degrees when I was there),7.5
Excellent location good food and friendly staff. Room was spacious and decent size. Breakfast was good but no variation from day to day.  The room had basic facilities but the shower could do with an upgrade and there is plenty of room to have a king size bed rather than a  standard double. It would also be nice to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room.   It would also have been helpful to have menus in English although we managed with Google Translator. ,7.9
We hat a problem with the heating in the room but it was quickly with the help of the staff resolved. ,7.5
Room is big and clean Breakfast is so so,8.8
Its comfortable clean wi fi was good breakfast was ok for the price its fine. Dinner menu could be better but thats a personal choice and you have some really nice restaurants on your doorstep,7.9
The breakfast was great and the staff very hospitable and helpful! ,8
Location Too hot in the room. No hair dryer.,7.9
Excellent location underground parking garage helpful staffgood breakfast big noise from the street,8.8
Comfortable bed cleanliness Thin walls a lot of noise kitchen under my room so at night I heard the dishes being washed.,7
so close to central station and this price includes the breakfast.  everything is good. next time I will select again ,9
The room and en-suite bathroom were very clean and tidy. Breakfast was good.  There was a good choice and the waitress was very friendly and accommodating. Given that it was the hottest day of the year we pleased that we were allowed to eat outside. We thought the picture of the square was of the hotel. It is not. Cheaper car parking is about 10 minutes walk and a pre-printed map would be useful.,8.8
Very cordial staff. Big rooms with all basic amenities. Nice breakfast. Our 2nd floor room had a great view of the square. Very close to the Rail Bus stations and all tourist attractions are walking distance. Lots of eating and drinking options in close vicinity. Stairs - narrow and steep. NO ELEVATOR! The October sun was soothing but the one in high summer can be harsh with no air-conditioning.,8.3
Helpfull staff Cold room on 3rd floor lots of building/painting going on.Lots of tins of paint everywhere,6.7
The breakfast was amazing!!! The room was way too hot and the TV was very old and did not show a clear image.,7
It is perfect for an overnight stay. It is 1 minute from railway station. The room was clean. The window opens on the street which is noisy due to restaurant terraces. Medium sized man may face a challenge in the shower cabin.,7
Especially if you come by train [for instance from the airport of Brussels] the location is perfect. -,7.9
Central economical stay.  No restaurants open nearby on Monday evening.,7.5
Located in the border village the French border is behind the next street corner. Several cafes and restaurants in walking distance and a bit further away the centre of Peruwelz also easily accessible. Next to a large cathedral. Slightly worn-out building but then again also inexpensive.,7.5
Very cheap and everything objective was fine but with a an air of past glories - very clean but with peeling paint. The town was similar with a Gothic basilica opposite and the border a few metres away. It is a real throwback in a 60s time warp. If you are on a limited budget and are tired of the squeaky clean chain hotels it is well worth the detour. ,7.9
Comfy bed cleanliness nice polite staff Wifi didnt work for me hard to communicate if you dont speak french,8
breakfast good for e9. bathroom wc not good small. ,5
The room was clean and the bed big. There were complimentary tea and coffee facilities. The Basilica across the road was silent between 8pm and 7am. The blackout curtains were effective and the large window opened wide. My French is sub-GCSE and reception made no attempt to slow down to help me understand despite asking. The whole place is almost derelict and has seen better days. The bar in the square below was occupied by scary looking men. I wouldnt have been happy to have stayed here on my own. There is only street parking but it is free.,7.1
Nothing Very over priced 400 hundred for week wouldnt even give complimentary tea and coffee  had to ask stay away people,2.9
Location sound proof bedrooms and breakfast No on site car parking,9.6
Really great location and wonderful staff. The room was a decent size and the shower was excellent  The were not enough hangers and the room needed another mirror closer to a power outlet.,8
Ondanks corona was alles correct geregeld ,8
Hotel is nicely situated. Room is quite big and clean. Service OK. Staff OK Stains on the carpet. Plastic shower door (not suitable for a 4 **** hotel) Holes in the bed sheets. Lamp not working. A lot of little details not acceptable in a 4**** hotel. Not a good value for money,5
Location wise next to train station and all the stores. 10 min from the beach .  The rooftop pool was closed due to COVID and didnt manage to enjoy the reason why I booked this hotel.,7
Comfortable beds. Very clean and staff were accommodating and friendly especially during the COVID-19 period! ,8
The pool on the top roof That the pool was not open in the morning The distance to the beach,8.3
The hotel was a short walk from the bus stop for Charleroi airport though not easy to find the route. Its also very close to Lemonnier Metro station for easy access to the centre. ,8
5 mins walking to Brussels Zuid station air conditioner is not working window is facing a tiny atrium without any air coming in shower is small which I can hardly turn around the body inside the only chair in the room is very dirty,3.3
Location closed to Midi Zuid station. More halal food near hotel. Old lift and long waiting!,6
The hotel has a good location it is only a few minutes from the Brussels Midi station. The elevator in the hotel is a funny one since it does not have internal doors. :) The room was okay for a short stay. As an overall opinion: the hotel has a good value for the money. The room was small.,8.8
 Bad windows insulation a lot of noise from busy street.,7.9
The hotel is very near to midi station about a 5 minute walk My room was cleaned every day had 3 good nights sleep  The hotel is in a bit of a rough neighbourhood Be careful at nightFound the wi-fi kept going  down There wasnt much choice at breakfast And found some of the staff a bit miserable Dont think I would stay here again ,7.1
Close enough to the station Dirty gross lights in the bathroom not working spots of dirt and probably other human liquids that place hasnt been vacuumed since 1700 ripped curtains general dirt.,1
 Rude staff it took them more than one week to send me their invoice (as they failed to give me one upon check-out),6.3
Location cleanliness and friendliness of the staffs.  Nothing,10
Very good value for money exactly as expected very convenient location near Gare du Midi smooth checkin and checkout. ,8
 A/C not working so are some plugs. Go for it if you are booking for a very short stay. ,5.8
The internet service is perfect and the rooms are very comfortable. It is 5 minutes away from the train station and 15 minutes away from the Grand Place. The is a little bit of noise at nights because just next to the building there is a night club.  The lift is really old and the moment I was about to leave the hotel the lift got stuck with people inside.. but at the end it was nothing extremely bad.,9.6
its location is good if you want to stay with Middi station ,5.8
Nice location next to the train station The room was clean and well equipped. Very good value-for-money Nothing to report,8
Generally I have no real complains because I expected a catastrophe based on the descriptions of the area and some negative reviews of the property. However the room was fairly spacious bed genourmous bathroom ok everything clean towels changed every day. I assume we had one of the renovated rooms so I speak just for our experience. The fact is that the exterior of the hotel (and immediate area) is bad and the hall and stairs are extremely narrow and ancient. We didnt even want to try the elevator.,8
 Last choice If you dont have anywhere else to stay.,2
Very good last minute price of 49$ unbeatable for the location next to Gare du Midi. A late night convienence store and cheap restaurant are right next to the hotel. lift could be dangerous for children. Stairs are the typical tight continental kind found in France and a Belgium.,9.2
 The area isnt the best but the proximity to the centre is good. That said we didnt have any problems  its just a matter of taste.,7.5
 All sockets connected to one switch. No possibility of using lamp. Fresh paint strong smell and the heating was not working,3
Easy access from the airport. 1.2 km from the main square. We missed electricity quite often. Elevator out of order for more than 2 days. The area is the worst in Brussels not safe in the evening at all! Place to avoid.,4.6
Rooms and bathroom are very spacious. The lift needs serious replacement.,7.5
The rooms are big quite comfortable and clean. As said above the location was perfect for work purposes.  The area. But for work purposes it was perfect.,8
Double room was very good clean and tidy and quiet at night good clean tiled shower room. Break fast was good friendly staff The area of the hotel is a little rundown but only 5min walk from eurostar terminal and train links to all of Belgium,8.8
Hands down worst hotel I have ever been in my life. It was awful extremely dirty shower drain was clogged furniture were old staff were impolite very noisy at night. ,2.9
 The fire alarm was blinking right above the bed so after turning off the light and trying to sleep a flash of green light disrupts the darkness and your hope of falling asleep. I stayed up until 5 am so I could be so tired to sleep with the major light on cos sleeping with the big light on was at least better than a green light flashing in between unpredictable periods of seconds. For the next night in Brussels I booked somewhere else to save my sanity.,4.6
The room was booked as budget  SINGLE however it looked like i was in comfortable double room already. A 3min walk to Gare-Midi. ,8.8
I loved and enjoyed the staying wonderful spot ,6
Was like walking through a war zone said it was on the doorstep of south train station well thats one hell of a big door step  ,4.2
The staff was charismatic and helpful the room was ok. Is a humble hotel which is fine although it can be cleaner.,6.3
Nothing there I liked The size of the room size of the bed size of the bathroomNo wardrobe,4.2
The staff was very nice Not like in the pictures they didn t have all the facilities listed on booking. The bathroom was leacking.,4
Staff very friendly room was clean and comfortable.Easy location to train station and walking distance to centre The neighbourhood seemed a little shady also other guests were quite loud,7
Quiet room The lift doesnt work as well.,7
everything was good  thank you! internet connection,9
good location to use  public transport to airport and bussiness road under construction,8
Low price. Room is old fashioned. Location is good only if you need to be next to railway station.,5.8
Its walking distance from Grand Place a 24/7 store next door clean nice room too No air conditioning so I didnt sleep well at the 6th floor on the inside of the building. No wind as well,5
Just about 400m from Zuidstation (Midi) and convenience stores staples restaurants all within 2 minutes walking distance. Comfortable stay overall. Very helpful staff and they have a small cloak area too to park your luggage after check-out. Small lift very noisy on Friday/Saturday nights - loud music and people yelling from the club next-door near after midnight until about 3AM next day.,7.9
The bed is comfortable and the staffs are nice ,8
The location is perfect - very close to the train station easy to get from/to the airport or other cities and also close to main city attractions. Staff was very pleasant and helpful rooms were clean with huge beds. The internet connection was poor sometimes and breakfast was a bit the same every day. But generally everything was fine,9.6
Location near the station Overall look and feel of the property is very bad and shady. You do not feel safe in there and the pictures do not reflect the reality.,5.4
Globally all was fine. Hotel has been refurbished although could still do with a new lift.Room is big and comfortable/clean. Staff are friendly.  Location. Although it was perfect for work.,8
Location is good there are centre of Brussels.  It was very hardly. Appartment very small. I asked water and men on reception answered that I should going to another hotel for buying water),5
A miserable hotel with poor facilities and uninterested staff. I suggest you go somewhere else Location. Tatty. Poor breakfast.,3.3
 It was the worst experience of my life. I had booked a double for two nightswe slept one night but the next day when we came in the afternoon back to our room our things where missing. I went to the reception and my luggage was in the luggage room because they mixed up the room numbers. The hotel thought we forgot to check out!!! All my things were packed by someone in our suitcases and in plastic bags!!!! Unacceptable!!!!!,4.6
Only hotel I found. Y You get what you pay for. Location is awful. Hotel is old and lift is dodgy,4.2
Honestly I didnt like the property at all. We expected more. The staff in the morning however are helpful and understood our concerns. I am sorry but its too old. The lift is too small only fits two people and sensors is temperamental need to stand in angle it to works.  The stairs are far too steep and unsafe.  ,4.6
Receptionist handled things really well. We had smooth check-in and checkout process. ,9.6
Nice friendly reception The water in the shower drained very slow.,8.8
Friendly staff clean and fully equipped bathroom Location dark room,8.8
The receptionist was so gentle and helpful.  Hes a great guy. I think those pillows need to be changed,9
Small rooms but it has everything one might need and everything was clean and worked well. Location is perfect at 5 minutes walking distance from the South - Midi train station. Price is very reasonable considering the location and the quality of the room. Staff was moderately friendly and there was some leakage from the sink. But this was a minor issue.,7
Location The receptionist could do with a lot more training on customer service. Didnt get a double room as booked. ,2.9
 Old smells bad towels dirty not clean,3.8
very smal well furnitured room with a window opening on an airshaft. But clean and very kind staff. elevator next to my room making noises most of the night. Neighborhood between two sexssaunas only for men.. Not the nicest place to arrive late at night.,5
- close to the train station - very comfortable rooms good beds good heating - friendly staff - on Sundays theres a big market on the place in front - shower pressure is amazing! - you can leave your bags there after check out neighbourhood is dodgy,8
It was actually pretty good THe reviews are not the best yet it is a very good place good room and everything. ,8
Its in 5 minutes walk from the Zuid Railway station Sound isolation tv position - it is too high.,6.5
Breakfast was amazing croissants pain au chocolat good cheese very abundant and tasty. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was a bit run down mold on the walls it was very small but for one night it was adequate.,6
Very close to the train station good for 1 night WiFi was very slow in my room,6.3
 Hotel was in bad condition room had the AC which wasnt working. Only one electricity bulb was working. For charging you electronic devices No switch though staff was very friendly they gave own fan location was very accessible through public transport but yet the area was too crowded when you travel please be aware of your belongings you can easily be robbed. ,1
It is close to the train station The pillows were not comfortable,6
The staff was really customer friendly and the breakfast was really nice . ,7
the price and the location were good for brussels I had some irritations after sleeping there. I have a really sensitive skin though.,7.5
Big room bigger than expected. Clean and big room.,4.2
Clean refurbished well located! Extra super strong smell of cigarette the whole night! If you are allergic or dont like smoke dont book it. Somebody was constantly smoking inside of the hotel. I changed the room because the smell of the previous room was awful the second was slightly better but the smell came trough the bathroom and I had to sleep with the window opened - 2 degrees!  Sound proof between the rooms horrible. Could hear peoples conversation right next to my room at 1 am.,5
The room with a double bed was perfect. It was quiet and comfortable. The hair dryer was not working.,9
Comfortable bed nice staff the heating Still dirty underneath the bed and table.We had the smell of weed from the window.There were road works going on in front of the hotel,7
 Hotel location is too dangerous for night. And rooms are too hot it is impossible to sleep at night. Building is too old.,3.3
- Good price-value combination - 20 min walk from the city center very close to Brussels-Midi - nice TV program selection - no 1h earlier check-in was possible - neighborhood is a bit sketchy but overall okay - room smelled a lot like a cleaning agent,7.5
The hotel was of a high standard. Food very good On Fri evening restaurants were closed for a function. Food served in lobby bar ! Could have been better organised. Bad practice closing both restaurants to guests,10
Staff was u helpfull. Airport pick up was almost double the price. Hotel did not want to support me on that issue Airport pick up. Reception desk workers are very unhelpfull,4.6
Excellent location in the heart of Minsk friendly and helpful staff good value for the price ,8.8
Central location with comfortable rooms and friendly staff. English spoken well. Fine breakfast but not best coffee or bread otherwise all fine,7.9
the room was nice and comfy. bathroom with bathtub comfortable bed i had views to the back side of the building which is not that nice,9
Everything was fine! The light on the room was pretty poor. Ive traveled for work and I needed it. The breakfast was pretty poor.,8
 Every night a lot of noise on the floor due to drunken people coming home from the city. That disturbed my sleep and resulted in me not being rested for my meetings the following day.,7.1
Wonderful location! No negative comment!,9.6
Location was great and staff very helpful. Airport transfer was easy and good value for money. The level of cleaning was under all levels. No smoking - room? Really strong smell of tobacco!,5.4
Fitness centre free parking good location very quite room Bed was too soft and very noisy.,9.6
Great setting - nice view over the fabulously Soviet post office or Lenin square. Noise isolation of rooms is poor - Corridor noise leaks in also.Felt that the bedroom could have been more attentively cleaned,7.1
Good location polite reception staff. Very thin walls can hear people in other rooms talking and watching TV. Staff chatting outside in the corridors so very noisy.,6.3
Locationcleanstaff  Breakfast the same every day,7.5
Clean hotel friendly staff. Location is in the centre of the city.  ,7.5
Perfect location in the heart of Minsk Too expensive breakfast,10
Location Servicebed restaurant and barno food services at night,5.4
Location is very good. Rooms are clean. Hotel is quite old. I think renovation is a must.,6.7
I was given suite instead of superior double room the size of rhe bathroom and water wash of the toilet. Room number 210 has really dirty carpet with white and black spots all around the room also I saw some insects in the room.  I think  because room is  dirty the have prompted my room to suite. The staff reception should give the best room to the customer not the bad. Food menu not in English.,6.3
Location of the hotel and hair conditioner :) ,7.9
very good location and good facility be fully aware of your amount of the payment and exchange rate.,7.1
I thoroughly enjoyed everything of the Minsk hotel and will be back to stay. I like the late night 24hr bar as I think its great for hotel patrons. Dont lose that. Not much,9.5
Simple 2 star hotel but in the heart of Brussels. What you need else when you are coming for one day visit in this city? You can take the breakfast for 5 euro per person. No fridge in the room :-(,9.6
The location is really nice plus the balcony was a nice touch. The cow blankets were really nice,8
Location staff and cleanliness In the room there are no glasses for water or cups for tea. It would help a lot.,8
Location is very central and good value for money. Shower without a tray so it resulted in a mess in the bathroom.Room hasnt adequate lighting.,7.1
Staff in hotel supported with any doubt and really nice Rooms need to be harder cleaned (also room clothes need to be changed) and some parts repaired,5.8
Close to everything.. TV did not work and not fixed until last day,6.3
Great value no frills very comfortable beds housekeeping very good linen nice and clean desks to work on balconies to watch the world pass by and a great location too They need to redo their decor.. renew some room features,10
The location is wonderful only a few blocks away from the Grand Place. The staff is very friendly the rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast is delicious. ,10
Good solid room bed shower etc all good. Wifi was a bit rubbish and often wouldnt work.,9.2
 No window no fresh air just hot and noisy neighbours thin walls..,5
Comfortable bed and pillows. Lift was a bonus. ,7.5
The room was clean warm and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful as always (this is the 2nd time Ive stayed in this hotel). Ive never had any problems and staff are literally sat at the Reception Desk 24/7 for whenever you have a question :) My room unfortunately didnt have a view. Buildings the street - any view would have been nice. Mine was sadly like looking down an elevator shaft! I dont mind usually but having a view like this really made my room dark..and I kept sleeping in late every morning because no sun was shining in through the window!,8.8
The room was warm and cosy. The bed sheets were bit thin and i believe not that clean. But apart from the qualification of hotel. This hotel have the best receptionists in Brussel. So kind warmhearted understanding and helpful. Best of Brussel! Bed sheets.,7
Great location. 20 minute walk to Gare du Midi. Metro 50 meters away 2 stops. Next door great cafe and hamburger place.5 minutes from Manneken Pis and Grand Place and manybshops and restaurants. The elevator was broken on arrival and departure. 8 flight of stairs with NO handrails,7.9
None. If you are choosing the hotel in Brussels - that is not an option believe me. Everything is broken dirt everywhere.,2.5
Good location good for 1-2 days business trip. ,5.8
The hotel is a palace in Place Fontainas just besides the Moeder Lambic. So its cool to crush there after some nice beer sessions. Staff is cheerful and gentle. Doesnt smell properly good in the stairwell. Facilities are old and somewhere run-down. Washbasin are small did they designed for dwarves?,7
Perfect location just 5 minutes from Grand Place friendly staff clean rooms. TV in the room was not fully functional.  Shower is not fully equipped resulting in water leaks out of the shower area to whole bathroom. Apart from that no complaints and recommend to stay.,9.2
Location was very close to center! Wifi was terrible!,7.9
The location was just perfect. It was on a walking distance from most major attractions in the city. There are plenty of cafes restaurants and shops nearby. It is also very convenient to go back there after walk in order to take a little break and continue. The room was clean and looked pretty much the same as on the pictures. Our room was in front of main street so it was very noisy. We did need to use ear plugs in order to sleep good. Our bed was supposed to be a big one but instead it was two single ones placed next to each other which start to separate every time you move. The sink in the bath was very small so every time you have to wash the water was streaming down the floor.,7.5
Staff is very friendly. Close to city center. Good price My room was without any view and also the noise and talkings coming from the lobby a lot. Bathroom is not so clean. Just check the ventilation device. So many dust. The lamp out of it is place. And i saw hair on the floor.,7.1
The location is pretty good really in the city center close to many attractions. All the staffs are nice polite and willing to offer help. The room is old and the facilities are kind of broken. Its newly painted so the room is full of the bad smell of paint which really made us uncomfortable. The most important the hotel may not be clean. All of us got herpes on our body especially on feet hands and arm. This really annoyed us.,6.3
Close to main attractions. Very small room. Weird smell inside. You can hear all conversations from other rooms. Not very clean. Toilet was in vary bad condition. Broken hairdryer. Window just opposite the wall so the room was completly dark. Too hot in the room.,3.3
Location. Very close to downtown. I paid( pretty much!) a single room including TV and the lighting-yes no matter what strange it would be!!! The room was very dark no bulbs in the ceiling the only lighting source was the neon lights above the bed which did not work! Just he next day after my insistence was brought into my room a small light that shines discreetly just not to think youre in dark! Tv programs did not work in room( but at the hotel lobby they were running!). The staff told me either there are some working on streets around hotel area or is a plumber who deals the problem but whom Ive not seen!,3.8
The location was probably the only redeeming quality of this particular hotel. It was pretty easy to find and just a short walk to everything that you need. The room was filthy. The whole hotel was filthy to be honest apart from the reception area. Paint was peeling off the walls the toilet in my room had not been cleaned or even flushed which was pretty disgusting the bedding its self I didnt even dare take the top cover off. The noise is the worst Ive came across it sounds like someone is stamping up and down the hallway through the night. I think I slept fully clothed on top of the bed for about 2 hours and I think exhaustion is what allowed me that much sleep. I know this is a 2 star hotel but there is no way it should be given more than 1.,4.2
A few minute walk to the Mannekin Pis and Grand Place 10-15 minutes to Brussels Central and there are many restaurant options around the area. Clean room and functional toilet and bath. Breakfast was okay for the 5 euro extra. Wifi TV and heating were all not working inside my room in the 4th floor. No telephone or intercom. You have to take the lift back and forth just to ask something at the reception (e.g. Wifi password breakfast time etc. - as they dont proactively give you this information). Reception staff could be better. ,8.3
The property is centrally located. The property is only good for 1 nights sleep for long periods I do not recommendWe knew for this price we couldnt expect more but it should still be cleaner,7.1
The ubication is nice . It is close from the center but  the room was cold . This was a litle uncomfortable yo have a shower for exemplo. The room was cold.,7.5
 Terrible radiator! Its too freezing and my friend got a cold. Nobody solved this problem even previous clients have complained. The staff suggested us to have a big hug to get warm. Its really nice thank you!,3.3
The breakfast was adequate Th room was too small and sink basin was very small.,7.5
it is near metro and in centre of cultural and historical places.room was nice and have big bed. ,7.1
Friendly and helpful staff comfortable bed and good showers.  Excellent location. The room was very cold.  The hotel is nice but needs some TLC.,6.7
Staff friendly Room needs major upliftNot value for money at 145 euro a night ,3.8
Convenient and inexpensive. Staff friendly. Simple french breakfast - convenient. Ventilation. Room was a bit smelly. Lift was small.,7.9
Great location lift. Need some hooks on walls to hang towels coats etc. ,9.6
Location: a 7-min walk to the Grande Place Very small room and bathroom (especially the sink),7.5
Good location near metro station. Good breafast for the price clean room. Without heating during a day in november a man from the reception didnt wake up us for the early morning flight although he promised and wrote to do it.,5.8
The location is perfect They need a lot of maintenance,7.1
Great and very central location Bathroom too small bathroom sink far too small cleanliness too low small cockroaches everywhere,5.8
The location was good close to Grand-Place and easily accessible via the 3/4 line of the Brussels tram The rooms were extremely small and cramped. 2 people in a room is pushing it. The bathroom was acceptable but the shower tended to leak everywhere. The rooms were clean upon arrival.,6.7
good location friendly staff realistic price ,5.8
The location is perfect it is very much in the city centre. So its great to access all the sights around there. Its a cozy place and is value for money The radiator took quite a while to start warming up the room and since the temperature was very low we were cold for a while that could have been remedied.,8.3
Clean and spacious room  great location right in the city center very kind receptionist -,9.6
Position cleanliness elevator renovated very small room very little light and fresh air the window exiting in an interior space no space for luggage,6.7
The room was clean. The staff is really nice. It is very close to the city center.  There was just a sliding door between the room and bathroom.We could hear all our neighbors the walls are too thin I think. The front door was making noise even if it was locked.Early in the morning we smelled the breakfast while we were sleeping.The toiletries were just towels and liquid soap. ,6
Rooms are large right in the middle of everything big bathroom. Really good all around. This place used to be a dump but you can tell theyve invested time and money into it finally. The doors are thin so you can hear whats going on in the hallway and vice versa.,9.2
bed ok bath ok room a little small but acceptable,7.5
Location. Very close to most attractions but next time Id rather stay a bit farther as this was not a pleasant property. Horrible smell. Room and the whole property had the 90s vibe but not in a charming way. The area did not feel safe.,4.6
Location The main entrance is not well illuminated,7
It is located in the centre of Brussels close to the important touristic attractions. It s clean and the personnel is very nice and friendly. -,9.6
Within walking distance from the train station polite staff reasonably sized room bed a bit slim but I pushed the two together hot shower quiet seemed safe close to historical sights. Narrow bed. TV didnt seem to work or maybe I was making a mistake Internet cut out for short periods.,8
The hotel offers accommodation at a relatively reasonable price very nice and helpful personal The hotel room is very small and it was oriented to a very small damp skylight so the room was dark all day the window could not be ventilated the skylight was musty. I do not recommend staying in room no. 14!,6.3
 no heating in the room  .  no  remote control for the   tv  .   bed was ok .pillows v hard  .  price expensive for what  one got      .,5
location I was only provided with a bath towel. When I asked for a hand towel the person at the reception gave me a bath mat. I refused the mat and he then gave me another bath towel as he said that hand towels were not available. Furthermore I did not find any cloth hangers to hang two pairs of trousers.  When I again asked the receptionist he said that these were not available.,5.4
Great location kind and helpful staff clean room. The room could be bigger. We had triple room.,9.6
Very Gold location Room was cold at night.,7
my room viewbreakfast staff politeness  poorly tv canal selection,7.9
Location Hair in the shower stains on duvets,4.6
 Room was so cold. There was no proper heating. heaters work only 8 pm to 1 am and it was below 0 outside ƒ± froze in my room. Yesterday night ƒ± comeback to hotel a 1:45 am and entrance door to hotel was locked and receptionist didnt even try open the door for while and did some angry gestures like ƒ± disturbed him and drag him out in his comfort zone. (he was watching tv) he was like why are you here on this hour,3.3
The hotel is near to city center The beds and bathroom. No comment,5
Nothing Have written a letter of complaint already.,4.2
In centre of Brussel. Money worthy. Elevator is working but pretty slow.,8.3
Very good location.Very simple but good breakfast(5$pp)The water in the shower is very hot(nice when you want take shower after a long walk)Friendly staff and really helpfullPrice/quality The heatingsystem didnt work in the bathroom.it was freezing there.When you take shower the doors dont close good with as result the water go slowly to the rest of the bathroom and even the bedroom.And there are works going on outside to make a new streetthe workers start @6:00u in the morning but the hotel can not help it.,7.5
The location was just perfection!Right in front of a bus stop and train station so very good access to everywhere. It is a walking distance from Grote Market and the best touristy spot in Brussels.The staff was very welcoming and helpful thus making our stay quite memorable. Nothing in particular.,7.9
 The bathroom was not clean and the furniture was in a very bad condition. The sink was way to small. The Key to the WLAN was not issued during checkin and not provided in the room. The windows had almost no insulation against the cold from outside or the traffic sound in front of the hotel.,5
Good value. Good Location. Decent clean. Very nice staff. Could use a COAT HANGER and a BEDSIDE TABLE next to the bed - I had to use a chair.,7.9
Only the location is good. Heater inside the room doesnt work. Hair dryer is spoiled. Water will splash anywhere. We ask the staff to check our room heater he keeps asking us to wait and we wait for him one hour. He just tell us that the whole hotel heater is fine only our rooms doesnt work he just gave us one more blanket..,2.5
Location is good nice bars around There was a tick on my bed the hotel seem to have very bad maintenance in the late times,4.2
Location - walking distance to Grand palace and Manneken Pis Only Shower curtain not door. - water will splash out from shower area end up toilet wet,7.5
 got bed bugs bite all over the whole body. very itchy and painful. terrible!,5.4
It was very close to the centre to transport and to amenities.  No food being served or access to coffee/tea was a little drawback.  The staff were friendly and the place clean. The bed was quite uncomfortable it was a little too cold and for the price it was surprisingly cramped.,7.1
The room has thin walls so it was very noisy. The bed was uncomfortable  Very good location helpful staff. The room was enough for two people. There was Showder gel towels and plastic cups as well.,7.9
The room was nice and comfortable the staff were helpful you have pretty much all you need The location was good a few minutes walk from the Grand Place and the Manneken Pis but not very close to any metro station. The hotel room was a little bit expensive and you dont get a free breakfast.,7.9
Peronal was friendly and helpful. The room was clean. The location is just perfect. The room was so very smal,7.9
Good location Big room and well iluminated Good price Killing stairs Unsafe elevator Tiny bed,7.5
Friendly staff who let me use the big refrigerator because there are no refrigerators in the rooms. Clean bathrooms. great location. Noisy outside so it was hard to sleep. Also no air conditioning so hot summer nights are sweaty.,8.8
 The cleanliness and towels in the room and not so much damaged furniture,3.3
great location for the central market.  free on street parking or pay garage very close. sticklers about check-in time.  would not even give us Wifi password while waiting in lobby.,5.8
 My room didnt have real window it was pointed to emergency shaft. So no light and it was smelly.,4.6
Excellent location very close to the centre of Brussels and only a 15mins walk from both Midi & Central Stations Room was quite warm and stuffy. Opening the window helped but the streets were quite noisy.,8.8
The hotel is super nice and comfy washrooms was attached and room was clean and quite. it has big balcony attached. Super happy with the room. we stayed 2 nights staffs are friendly and co operative. Will book again. All the main spots are walking distance from the hotel. ,10
Very clean and very central area ! Nice staff. No natural light in the room the window opens towards a wall (same for all single rooms apparently).,8.8
The location couldnt be better! Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. All the men at the reception were nice and very helpful. The room was really small the heating didnt work at all so had to ask the receptionist to bring additional blanket then it worked. TV didnt work either but its not a big deal,7.9
Very good location 24hour reception helpful staff Cold room no air conditioning no lights dark room in the night no place to leave things except for one desk dirty blankets,5
Comfortable beds good size rooms and reat showers. Scrambled eggs at were made of something other than egg!,7.5
Really large room for this Price. And the location is perfect. ,9
 The room was full of mosquitoes. We barely slept 2 hours and spent the whole night trying to kill them all -> evidences on the wall . ( sorry for that) Our body is covered by bites,6
Location is suberb. Breakfast is delicious. Very authentic hotel. Noice isolation is not great.,8
Location for exploring Ghent Booked a Superior room based on the Booking Web site photos to get the best quality room. But on arrival given a room no better than Standard in quality. Management said all rooms different but I said that the room paid for should still be of a similar Superior standard to that advertised. They blamed Booking.com for this but I dont. Very misleading - be warned! Make certain you are going to get what you are paying for!,4
The location is absolutely perfect for sightseeing. The flavor and atmosphere of the hotel is fantastic. It is as if you were in an ancient building. In fact this was my second time I went there and I couldnt find anything which was not at the level of my expectations. Nothing I dislike of the Monasterium.,9.6
Very helpful friendly staff and great location ,8
I imagine staying at the monasterium is great but I wouldnt know. It looked really nice. Why I chose this hotel (and pay a higher rate) was because of the experience of staying in an old monasterium. Our room was in a newly built building in the parking lot next to the street not in the Monasterium. Even though it was a quiet street if a car drove by you could hear it and wake you up. Imagine paying to stay at a castle and then that your room is in the shed next to it. The receptionist was zero helpful and zero friendly it was a really bad experience. All the pictures show the old rooms and the Monasterium which is what I paid for and at the end we arrived to something completely different.,1
A very interesting building with comfortable rooms good facilities and friendly and helpful staff. Having car parking was a bonus. ,10
Breakfast options were very good. Location to main square also very good. Staff was very accommodating. Difficult to see hotel signage on the street. More lighting in the yard would be appreciated when coming in late at night. Lack of elevator slightly inconvenient with heavy luggage.,9
Every thing else great location and breakfast  Price,9.2
Room was comfortable and clean. Quiet at night. Signage from the entrance to the room is poor and its easy to get lost in the many corridors.,7
Friendly staff comfy beds quiet room water boiler for coffee/tea breakfast ambience ,9
By the sound of the other reviews I think we received one of their newly refurbished rooms. The room was very modern updated and clean. It came with a coffee machine and little fridge as well. We loved the breakfast as well and having tea throughout the day. The hotel was very beautiful and historic!  The breakfast is a little too expensive to be worth it every morning.,10
Staff were excellent really helpfull.  Carparking was on site - quite a rarity in Bruges. Room was spacious but no drawers bedside tables or wardrobe! hense the scoring down (there was a rail for clothes).  Breakfast was great and the ambiance of the hotel was good.  Very close to the centre of town. There needs to be a little bedroom furniture.  It was not a great problem for us as we only stayed one night but if you were staying longer it could be annoying,9.2
Very convenient located. Excellent staff. Amazing bilding. Small selection on breakfast. No fruits or vegetables. Other than that everything good!,9.6
 Had to have roomservice breakfast due to covid measures but there was no table or surface to eat comfortably. The breakfast was subpar mostly bread.,5
The staff were delightful. The secure parking was excellent. Our room overlooked a small canal and the hotel garden so it was very quiet. Our room was very small. However we had everything we needed including a fan during the hot weather.,7.9
The location the environment.  Too expensive for what it was. Not much choice for breakfast.,5.4
Clean good continental breakfast. Bathroom- area between loo and opposite wall is very small if your over 6ft then It will be a struggle !Shower good.Car parking at 20euro/ night is steep!,7.5
Perfect location in the center of Brugge yet on a quiet street. Minimalistic but comfortable room. Lovely breakfast. Good parking facility (although a bit pricy)  The rooms were not very sound proof with some noise from the corridor or neighboring rooms.,7.9
The breakfast was really good. The offer was good and the coffee was amazing. They also had good suggestions for people with allergies. The fire alarm went off in the night and how the personnel responded to the fire alarm was not good. I worked in hotels myself and the actions taken from the moment that the fire alarm went off were not good and not safe if there turned out the be real fire.,6.3
The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas they had made a lovely effort to make the hotel look seasonal and beautiful. The staff were also really friendly and helpful and gave us a map and some advice on where to get some drinks during our visit. When we were staying there there was a large party of women (possibly a hen party) staying at the same time they were obnoxiously loud the walls are quite thin they were very loud when they came back in after their night out and no one in the hotel told them to be more respectful of other guests. They were also incredibly loud at breakfast time again.,8.8
 The staff is not friendly at all we felt as if they were doing some favor to us by letting us stay in the hotel.Their wifi password for customer says it all how relevant are we to them:WifiPassword was IrrelevantIts small thing but says the thinking of the staff.,3
Excellent design. Staff on reception very helpful and gave excellent tips on places to visit/eat whilst avoiding tourist traps.  The view from our room was amazing! The pillows were a little uncomfortable and the towels were a little small. Breakfast selection a little small.But thats only being very picky!,8.8
Friendly We where in a corner during the night there was a lot of noise in the other room. Doors where close to each other so we couldnt sleep,6
Super clean easy to find great staff parking and very good breakfast!  Walls are a bit paper thin but overall clean property!,10
Staff were excellent Period property really authentic on a canal,9.2
Peter the manager vas extremely helpful and a very nice gentleman Unfortunately because of the utilities companies laying new pipes and cables in all of the surrounding streets vehicle access to the area around the hotel is almost impossible.,9.6
The breakfast was very good and it was close to the seafront. ,8.3
Stayed here before good location in La Panne. Staff are very helpful. Great value. Nothing,7.9
Trustworthy Had all the essentials Adequate breakfast options Was woken up by building work at 7am opposite Floor boards very creaky in roomWiFi poor on 3rd floor,6.7
 NIGHTMARE. We went with a friend who had a single room. Unfortunately when he went to bed some itching started. He looked closer and found many small insects on the sheet in the bed. No one at the reception at 23h. Our friend couldnt sleep the whole night. When we complained the next day the owner was extremly nasty unfriendly and he ignored fully what had happened..,2
We had a family room with two extra beds so there was enough space. The hotel is a bit old and the design is old fashioned but it good enough for at least one night. The bathroom was quite small but the shower was good. No real extras in the room but that was expected. Breakfast and location are good. A little redesigning and this could be a nice old-fashioned styled hotel and they could even ask a bit more money for the rooms :-),7
Good location and breakfast friendly staff. The room was a bit dated. There were street repairs when we got there.,7.1
location was short walk from centre lack of cleanliness room looked like it hadnt been decorated since the 1970s,5
Room very spacious large bed well appointed. Excellent bathroom.  Coffee available but by vending machine only.. it is only 2 star accommodation so maybe this is normal. ,8.8
Fairly close ro main town on foot. Guy in reception very helpful and good english Top floir so very hot. And parking can be an issue. But to be fair probably same everywhere in brugge,8.8
Super friendly staff and near all important sightseeing places no need for transportation.  ,9
The location was good near to the train station nice neighborhood close to downtown and restaurants. The hotel gives you what you need for the price you are paying a clean bed and bathroom is not luxurious just a place to spend the night in a safe and clean environment. I traveled with my family including kids and it was good for our purposes. Just what I expected for the price.,6
The hotel Manager was very helpful and accomodating. The room was smaller than expected but it was comfortable and rooms were cleaned everyday beddings and towels are replaced everyday. We booked the triple room 15.. The room was a bit on the old side but beds are soft and comfortable. The location was also very nice about 10 mins walk from Bruge City center and you can reach every attractions by foot. Overall our stay was very nice and price was the most cheapest which is a steal given that we book on a peak season.. The bathroom needs a little improvement since the shower and the tiles looks old but its not that bad. need a little more cleaning on the vents..,8
 Uncomfortable bed and pillows alarm going off every five seconds until 3am,5.8
Great location and very friendly staff. In a quiet place but just a ten minute walk to the centre Room was on the second floor with no lift,9.6
Nothing miles from town cost us a fortune in taxi fares Missed breakfast second morning and charged us 2 euro for coffee,2.9
On a small quiet side street 5 minute walk from center city this hotel was excellent!  Good breakfast buffet and an excellent staff. ,9
Price No lift for elderly/ Poor soap bar / automatic light overnight /,7
Breakfast was good The shower in our room was dangerous no handles very slippery fell in shower the room very dark but beds comfortable and clean,7
Staffs are very helpful everything is in the right place! Within 10 minutes walking distance of the town centre. Nothing,10
It was close to the Market restaurants and bus stations.The staff was very friendly very welcoming and helpful with city information.  It was very dated and needs renovations. The floors squick too much.,6.3
Breakfast was sparse toast rolls or cereal No lift narrow steps on stairs difficult to climb for older clients. Toilets on first floor,5
Rubbish Needs deep cleaning Needs deep clean,1
The location is perfect. Has a nice view in a quite street close to all the atractions free parking close to the hotel.  For this price it should have been more clean more confortable. The smell in the whole hotel is not very nice. ,7
Very friendly decent continental breakfast and location  Dont they use toilet cleaner on the continent?,7.5
The recepcionist was extremely helpful The bed linen got holes,6
Close to the city center easily accessible very good mattresses friendly and hospitable personnel. Not as advertised: on the webpage the rooms look pristine the reality doesnt match. The ceiling showed clear signs of past leakages as well as the quaint wallpapers which had a yellowish tinge. Some of the light switches were missing their covers. There was no soap in the restroom discovered only after the fact. Worst of all the shower was full of mould which is a tangible health hazard. On a side note: included breakfast was a selling point to me on site we were told it wasnt included.After voicing our complaints the management granted us a discount to be fair but the room was still too expensive for the quality provided.,5.8
Everything was excellent from the the check-in the room breakfast etc. It totally met our expectations. The location really suited us. The owner was very attentive to make sure that everything was good. The staff were very efficient. The basin tap indices were the wrong way around. The hot tap had a blue one and the cold had a red one. That was the only issue and as long as you remembered that there was no problem.,10
Very near city centre.Still quite place. ,9
Location of hotel to main centre not too far to walk and the staff were very accomodating The thought on booking accommodation online was the breakfast was more than continental but nevertheless still a pleasant stay. The other thing that didnt come up on details was no lifts to the second floor my wife was pregnant at the time of the stay and with our son sharing our room was tiring.,7.5
relatively close to town center. quiet no lift as old building,8
Walkable from city centre Smelly room. No free parking within hotel premises. No elevator. Very basic breakfast.,3.8
Excellent service very friendly staff Nothing,10
Quiet good breakfast friendly staff None,7
It was walking distance to town station. Staff friendly.  I think Brugge in general is quite expensive for accommodation but this compared to elsewhere in Europe seemed expensive. The room was clean but the bathroom had bad smell all our stay.,5.4
Close to the city center. The room smels stale Alot of dust old and rundown furniture Badly painted broken shower tap Curtains that dont close bedsheets that dont fit over all messy look. Would not recoment staying here,2
10 minutes walk from the square. Room was clean & warm and the bed was comfy. Breakfasts as a bonus and plenty of choice and the staff were lovely. Nothing to dislike,7.9
Great location 5-10min walk from the centre. Its a small hotel and it feels very relaxed. The staff were really helpful and when we arrived to drop our bags off at 10am the room was already clean and they let us check-in straight away. This was lovely as after travelling overnight by boat it was great to have a shower before exploring.The breakfast was simple but more than you need. Nice breads and cereals with the usual meat cheese and egg accompaniments. It was also nice to eat in the conservatory which in the summer I imagine it lovely.Comfy bed hot and and powerful shower too. All for a great price.  Nothing I would definitely stay again.,10
Clean comfortable and lovely team Shower a little old but not a problem,8.8
Location is close to bruges centre can walk 10 mins. No fridge and no elevator during our stay it got very hot and no AC. It says free parking but parking is 6-7 min walk to a free public parking,5.4
The stuff was super friendly  eager to help every time with a polite and friendly way.  The price of breakfast was too high for the options and the quantity which they offer.  Moreover there was not enough shampoo and body gel for a shower.,8
 The room was smelly the furniture and the bath room dated windows uncleaned  full of spiders.  Overall not a clean and sanitized hotel. Not recommended.,4.6
Big room location. Quiet. Good breakfast on Tuesday Beds need replacing shower head needs replacing. Stair hand rail needs repair.no breakfast available Wednesdays,7.5
 The bed was 2 matteress on the floor  The shower head was held together with a plaster  Breakfast was sparce no toast or yogurt very disappointing,6
Location is good It has been taken over and the downstairs cafe/bar area has been done up the bedrooms however are not good basic chair broken holes in towels loose bannister on the stairs. Overpriced breakfast compared to much superior places available on the square,3.8
good location  the manager was very helpful. rooms were clean and comfortable. ,8.3
The Breakfast was offered at 15 euros per person Too expensive in my opinion . Awful smell of drains in the whole room coming via toilet /shower steep stairs ( ok I accept its an old building ) but the bannister was very loose,5.4
The meals were delicious. The mattress on the bed kept slipping off the bed.,7.1
Location only Lack of information and personel. No person in the hotel in the morning at all so no breakfast available. no one to ask for anything. Could not even get a cup of coffee and no facility in room either. Could only just leave the keys and depart. If it calls itself a hotel there should be some hotel service. Expensive for the quality of the room and service.,5
Nice view of the square Good service when checking in Bad drain smell from bathroom Very thin walls and windows. Noisy.  Lumpy pillows,6.3
 Great place to stay - excellent people - close to menin gate,8.3
Staff were friendly. Everything else was pretty grim - dark tatty room - smelly worn staircase - no mirror in the bedroom - and no wifi! The room was expensive considering the poor decor and level of comfort and facilities. The breakfast was expensive and very limited.,4.6
 The bloody noise from outside as they started building show stands at 2am and never stopped,7.1
The staff were very helpful and pleasant.  The location was excellent right on the main square in the town.   There was parking available in the square outside the hotel (paid separately but not expensive) The hotel is just very old and run down.  Tiny room third floor up rickety stairs couldnt get the tiny TV to work. Bathroom ok but tiny. Pillows dreadful. There was a sort of window but just looked on to buildings. This is a very budget and basic OLD place.,5.4
Great location lovely patio and the staff were really great. I was travelling with my 14 daughter and the staff were very polite and approachable.  Morning breakfast on the square was the best! Everything met expectations.  It isnt 300-400 Euros per night so if you book set your expectations accordingly.  Request a lower floor if you have trouble with stairs.,7.9
 No light in room plug sockets did not work,7.9
A simple old fashioned hotel but in an excellent location for the Menin Gate and the central square - an easy old world charm ,7.5
 The staircase was extremely steep with a very loose handrail. The breakfast was very poor for the price (especially compared to tSweerd next door.,5.4
The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. Great location. When we arrived on the Tuesday night we were informed there was no breakfast available on the Wednesday as the restaurant was closed. That was fair enough but a little frustrating especially as there was no tea/coffee facilities and there was no prior warning. The breakfast was very limited. As a vegetarian with a wheat intolerance I had very little.,8.8
The rooms are all very tired and small and in dire need of updating. That said the location is incredible and the staff are brilliant. Parking is right in front of the building and free for motorcycles its not secure but good enough.  Really tired rooms but acceptable for the price we paid. No air conditioning. ,8
Service and friendliness.the restaurant was also very good. ,9.2
Central locationsecure parkingprice Very uncomfortable bed (the mattress was on the floor!)tired fittings and furnitureextremely small bathroom with broken shower head(held up with sticking plaster!)very cramped stairs (defiantly not suitable for anyone with mobility issues),6.3
 The service downstairs was excellent. Location for attending the evening activities ideal. Meals were high standard.,9.6
 We arrived on a Tuesday to be told that the hotel would be closed on a Wednesday so there would be no staff and no breakfast - which we had paid for in the room rate. Ive never been to a hotel that accepted bookings and then didnt provide any services for them. The cleaner even turned the lights out on us after she left as we waited for a colleague - having woken us up in the morning by moving tables and playing the radio loudly. Nobody had even told her we were staying.,4.6
just the localization and the wifi were ok the rest was awful. room was unclean and smelly mold smell all over the place bed linen was not sufficient bathroom without places to put towels and check out with nobody to retrieve the keys. Very unorganized place! not recommended at all!,3.3
Great location we booked a room last minute and had the attic bedroom budget but. Great for the one night . Staff really friendly . Tired basic but good value .,7.9
great location - great breakfast - great staff all good,7
The staff and the food. Excellent The room was tiny. The price in the room brochure was a lot cheaper than we paid.,7.5
Location was exceptional right on the market square. The staff were friendly and the stay was pleasant. Breakfast was fine. The hotel is a little dated and in need of an overhaul. It is not a quiet hotel as any noise travels up the central stairwell so early morning activity in the kitchens woke us all up at 6am.  It is priced too highly for the facilities and decor that are offered.  If it was 20% cheaper it would have received a different rating - eg an 8 or 9. That said the location is perfect.,7
Superb location.  Plenty of restaurants in the area.  Good breakfast. I booked this hotel for my husband and two friends to see the war memorials.  On check in they had to pay for their room even though I had given the hotel my payment details.  As this was a present and booked on my card it was not with them.   I was not happy that they had to pay for a gift that I had given them. They said the foyer had recently been decorated but the upstairs rooms could use a facelift.,8.3
Very little! Decorating appalling carpets filthy stair banister broken (dangerous) bed should be in a skip. Price much too high for this poor quality of hotel - presumably boosted by the location.,5
Room was good comfortable bed view out of the window over the square was nice although fair on therefore noisy especially the hooter to stop/start the bumper cars but not hotels fault. Food was excellent staff great apart from the above all good. Breakfast too expensive and unable to accommodate our gluten intolerant also no facility for tea coffee in the room but that seems to be a continental thing as Amsterdam was the same.,8.8
The food was excellent and staff very friendly and welcoming The rooms we stayed in need major overhaul beds uncomfortable sheets ripped tho looks like work in progress as down stays clean and done up,6.3
Great location coffee staff were so helpful Sergio especially great food particuy the mussels ! The restaurant and bar areas beautiful however the hotel rooms need re-decoration.,8.8
Hotel is located in the town square a very short walk to the Menin Gate. Shops and restaurants and tour providers also very close. Ypres train station is only a few minutes by car or about 15 minutes walk from Old Tom. Good breakfast. Helpful friendly staff. It is a very old building and the facilities reflect this. But everything works its clean and very reasonably priced. ,8.8
The location and the view. Staff helpful with luggage. We werent told that the hotel is unattended closed on Wednesday which meant we had no breakfast which was included in the tariff. We were compensated 10 euros. Should have been 20 the price of two breakfasts.,7.5
I booked The Old Tom as I had stayed there about 20 years ago and it is perfectly placed in the main square in Ypres with excellent access to local facilities as well as the Menin Gate the Cloth Hall Museum and many other locations of interest. The staff were very helpful in an understated way and the breakfast was fine. The rooms were clean with good views over the square  All in all we really enjoyed our stay. The steps to the rooms on the third floor were steep and would be problematic for people with infirmities. It would have been good to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room and we did have trouble in finding the pre-booked garage. A small printed road plan with clear directions would help.,8.8
 The weather was pretty bad and we headed to spa. Short note - spa is in another hotel so youll need to walk till there and change there. And bring your own slippers or you will need to pay 5 EUR per pair. It was surprising to me in 4 star hotel.,7
Good breakfast but sauna is not that great ,7
The room was excellent breakfast very generous and delicious. Receptionist was unpleasant and in general staff not particularly friendly. Parking situation should have been explained in advance. I.e you cant approach hotel by car.,8
 The Japanse garden did not look cared. Very unussual for a Japanese garden,7.1
Breakfast was great. We had to get out of the building and go next to a construction site to reach the building with our room. There were not enough lights (or presence detectors) to see the way properly at night.,6.3
Great location for restaurants etc. Easy to get to Bruges or the Ferry port. Really nice breakfast and comfortable beds.  The air con came on by itself at 3am waking us up and the room smelled a little of dogs. Renovation work at the moment made it a little dangerous at night. ,8.3
Great location breakfasts uniqueness Couldnt access fresh air and room became a little stuffy,8.8
Nice location right near the city hall and trade square Noisy at night not easy to find parking place nearby. Narrow beds. ,7.9
breakfast and staff very nice. Good bar. Location is very central Street noise most of the night,6
Central location clean rooms good beds elevator. Good price.  You must sleep with a closed window the party  street is around the corner and the place need some renovation. Elevator doesnt work at night. ,7.9
Good breakfast In the centre so it is noisy,7.9
The location was perfect. A few steps from the maIn touristic attractions bars and restaurants. We needed to have breakfast earlier than the starting time and their organised  it for us.  The shower cabin was broken and the door to the bathroom was damaged. The parking is 500 mts away. ,7.1
Iconic central friendly clean. Old carpeted no shower curtain noisy,8.3
Have been many times at Hotel Professor as former student in Leuven 20 years ago visiting the city on a regular basis and its always nice especially when I get my favourite room at the hotel as happened this time. Besides this the hotel (I assume I am not offending anyone by saying it is more like a guesthouse not being so fancy at all) is just perfectly located in town. This time it was not as much live around the cocktail bar downstairs as it used to be before when I have been visiting (also of course meaning it was now very quiet for the night being beneficial for the guests sleeping over this time). The breakfast at the hotel is always very good while this time I was told it ended at 10 clock while homepage still says it should be 10.30.,8
The location is fantastic at the heart of this charming town. The hotel is in a historic well maintained and modernized building. The staff was kind and accommodating. The breakfast was delicious. Thank you! The closest longer term parking is the Q-Park Healing Heart parkade about 0.4 mile from the hotel.,8.8
Location in city center. Rooms and hotel in total is dated.,8
Nice but quite basic hotel in a perfect location. Friendly and helpfull staff. Simple but sufficient breakfast. Considering the very reasonable price its good value for your money. It was pretty noisy at night since there are quite a few bars and clubs in the immediate vicinity and the room didnt have soundproof windows.,8.8
Locarion is very good staff is nice and it is not expensive It was a bit cold in the room and a bit smelly in the bathroom,7.5
Very friendly people working there! The breakfast was very good and the Hotel literally is in the middle of the city - you couldnt be more central and you can reach everything by foot! Its rather loud because its surrounded by clubs and bars. Not the Hotels fault but it was tough to get a full night of sleep.,7.9
location is perfect staff is friendly good price/quality its a rather basic hotel it could use a make-over. Was very warm in our room (no airco) and too noisy with the window open. However there was a fan and with window closed we heard nothing (so that was good).,7.1
People are kind and helpful and they provide a  paied transport service to Brussles airport if you has a late flight and no transportation avaliable after 10 pm.Room was clean.Toilet was clean and roomy.Super fast WiFi in the room.For me the location was extra super perfect (i had a confrence in University city hall exactly the next door ).It is close to a lot of services and the street is full of resturants. There was no air conditionThe bed linen and coverings were not cotton and that made me sweat a lot at night and interrupted my sleepThe satillite TV was not connectedThe bath tub had no curtaines and its a mess if you had shower.The wall blugs were not comopatible with my charger  (photo provided),7.5
Rooms are renovated and pretty good. Beds are comfy.  Breakfast was also good with enough choice. A hotel without much soul. Public spaces are basic. Some hotel staff are friendly others barely force a smile.,7.1
Clean hotel very comfortable and a quiet location. Staff were not overly friendly or eager to help.,8.8
 There is no water heater or microwave ovenÔºõSomehow it is a little bit noise for express-way oriented rooms.,9.2
Hotel is very nice and clean. The check in was very unpleasant.   The staff was really rude and did not understand guess who arrived having travelled 6hrs in the car and to be told must wait another 45 mins to check in and to have wifi password.   This is a Ramada.   Service should be better than this.      Unsatisfied with the old lady who did the check in.,7.5
Staff friendly near bus route room clean. Room AC worked poorly and windows did not open. Cooked in my room. Also charged 180 for pet fee. Pet fee not clearly mentioned in adds or website. Wouldve booked different hotel for additional 180 Euro.,4.2
Excellent facilities very comfortable room. Excellent breakfast. Staff was very welcoming. Wifi was not working all the time in the room. Room was cold the heating was not enough.,7
there was a nice service at night male pleasent and helpfull We didn`t like the air condition at room was not working properly and we could not get the fresh air at the room was too warm sunny morning was making the temperature even higher I woud not like to come but there to the same room it is so important to feel fresh at the hotel,7.1
Very silent despite proximity to highway.  Good restaurant inside the hotel Windows could not open to change the air in the room.,8
Good breakfast. Staff at breakfast. The room stank of sewage upon arrival. Nevertheless I slept in and informed reception staff in the morning. Nothing was done and when I came back the room was as I left it - stinky. I traced the reason to a filthy shower curtain that I showered for some time with the shower hand held telephone and guess what bad smell went magically away. I informed the lady at the reception before leaving and she was very sorry but her male colleague did nothing about it when he had to. Totally unacceptable attitude from the reception and its not the first time - a annoying episode happened one year ago. This was my third visit to the Ramada Woluve and its going to be the last.,5
Very good breakfast and convenient location of the hotel. ,9.2
The restaurant staff (Jamal) was fantastic! No king size beds.,7.9
We have often used this hotel when visiting Brussels because its in an excellent location for getting into the city centre and because it has good parking facilities. The rooms are clean and comfortable the staff friendly and welcoming. If paying the full price for breakfast its very expensive compared to other hotels weve stayed in so weve often had breakfast in town for much less. Its good that theres a restaurant in the hotel (we were tired after a long drive and didnt fancy going out) but unfortunately the food we had suffered from spending too long in the microwave.,9.6
Good location. Good breakfast. Old and massive hotel! No ventilation in rooms.,5.4
Price. I was alone for 1 night and the (single) room rate was really cheap. Bath room was very modern and clean Building/Facility is a bit old. I traveled a lot and stayed at many different hotels but i dont think I ever wanna come back for this hotel. At least not for the full price. And it is very hard to find the hotel parking as some of  the roads near the hotel are closed for construction.,6.3
The room setup with the table for Laptop. only part time  room service . People at reception are not friendly,5
Property located in business area so it was quite safe. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff and policies.,7.1
Comfortable bed and extra pillows Free carparking No kettle or fridge or coffee / tea in the room,7.5
Old rooms and very cold with no TV Everything,5
Rooms were enormous. Widows very good and blocked street noise.  The gentleman host at breakfast was very good. All the rest of the staff were unbelievable rude or disinterested in the guests. Also one night I went to have dinner in the restaurant and saw at least 6 couples/individuals seated. Not one had any food except bread rolls. I walked through the 2 rooms twice and still saw no staff - no where! So I left.  Receptionist doesnt even look at you or stand up when you ask a question at the desk! Shocking! Shower door stupidly positioned - no place to put soap or shampoo in shower.  No plugs near the bed.  Tv takes up almost the entire desk.  Some of the coach loads of tourists were very noisy in the halls.,5
Peaceful quit easy to get the location away from traffic jam helped staff ,9
In the evening wasnt hot  water in the shower it was not good.  ,6.7
Such clean and confortable place. I really recommended Wifi access is very low,9.6
Not that i can say much about it Scruffy and it looks nowhere near a 4* hotel and for the price that we paid. It cannot be considered as a Business hotel.I will not recommend to any business travellers!!!,5
 Basically everything. There is not window in the room you cant have fresh air There is no minibar in the room which is crucial in such isolated area. Staff is not helpful  The room is not well equiped,2.9
The location is not central but it was ok for me. The staff was helpful and agreed to change my room as the one they gave me first had a noisy airco unit. The airco was better but also a bit noisy in the second room and could not be set to a comfortable temperature / fan level and I had to be switch it off during the night so I could sleep (and this was during the record heat wave in late July). Also the pillows were not great (one was too thin and two were too thick).,7.1
Staff is friendly Facility is basic location is not good nothing around  and the hotel reserved 150 euro for security deposit while there is no even bar in the room. First time I see that the hotel such big amount for security deposit which return only after 2 weeks from departure. Breakfast is average but costs 19 euro.Overall the hotel is 3 star basic,6.3
very good place for the price I think there are some impermeable sheet under the normal sheet thats why the bed could not breathe and I was sweatening at night. Also when you are taking shower it is too dark because the light is only on the other side of curtain,8
Very big room. Very bad personnel behaviour. The receptionist was very impolite and rude. The food at the restaurant was disgusting. The hamburger was burned outside and raw inside!  Terrible experience! I will never come back in this hotel.,3
Reasonable price and comfortable. Metro or train station is not close to the hotel.,7.5
silence.. Not only did not like I HATE it.. Today I had flight from CRL to SAW Istanbul I ordered a taxi from hotel to CRL Reception called a taxi driver told me 150 Euro did not open taksimetre and when we came to airport he said 205 Euro I asked why he told me that you asked a receipt He had to tell in advance RAMADA has to work with taxi drivers WHO is not cheating their customers. I trusted the taxi driver because RAMADA reception ordered but he lied to me and cheated. Thats why I really HATE liar & cheat taxi driver and unprofessional & untrustable reception of RAMADA experience.. I highly advice that go and find any other hotel..,3
the location is close the local office. in night the location is quite its easy for sleeping. The facilities are timeworn. the sofa is broken. Without some necessary accessory like slipper and cotter stick etc.,7
I asked for a large bed. I Specifically mentioned not to be given 2 attached beds. The bed was literally folding when sleeping. I had horrible sleep during the 2 nights there. tv connection slow. Could not watch tv. And towels were dirty. the most horrible accommodation experience i have ever had. staff were very uninterested disengaged. See aboveI DEMAND MONEY BACK. I have been using booking.com for a long time. Has been OK. This time: not ..,4.6
it was quiet. wifi almost did not work. everywhere! no lighting wall outlet (for charging my phone i need to charge it next to desk!,7
Best room size service was excellent and specially staff was highly professional. I highly recommend this hotel. There was nothing to dislike.,10
Nice and Cosy Room. Room was big enough. Overall it was nice hotel at the price i got it. 1. Shower Curtain needs to be changed. They are long enough so i cannot take them inside the tab while taking a bath. I kept it outside one day and most of the watch splash in the bathroom making whole floor wet.  2. There is a sign / notice about multiple use of towel in a bathroom and i wanted to use it next time so i followed the instruction but it seems the hotel management does not care about the environment.  3. Toilet seat water flow is very bad. Lots of wastage of water.,6
 The customer service and attention to request  Not being able to change my room as staff said they were fully booked still people were checking in until after 11 pm Staff are very unwilling to help,3.8
Room was comfortable Breakfast menu could have been better.,6.7
 The extra double bed gave too much noise.,7.5
Location and breakfast Smell of cigarette smoke in the corridors,7
It very very bad very small rooms WiFi isnt work at all from all location ( room and even Receiption) they let me wait 2 hours as the check in must be 3:00 pm on the other hand the check out should be before 11:00 am other wise we should pay 50 Euro if we need check out at 12:00 . I have asked for hard Pelow but they havent  One of the worst every ,3.3
Reception personnel and the friendly waiter who got me food at 10pm. Parking could have been better facilitated.,10
Good fixtures and fittings. Noisey air con unit that would not switch off at all due to noise I could not sleep.  I had to change my room 4 am in the morning and had to wake up my 10 yr old daughter in the middle of the night. Next day the receptionist with blonde hair (Middle aged lady) was grumpy and unfriendly - she was probably racist from what i made out.  Location is far out of centre of Brussels and you have to drive 5km to get to Ramada car park of this hotel.,6.3
Amazing location right in the center of Bouillon. Property was clean and the staff was friendly. A bit expensive for a small room with a shared bathroom (more like a hostel than a hotel) and the bed was very uncomfortable.,6.7
The breakfast the view on the river the food around The bedroom was so cheap. Matress was rubish.. The bathroom is very bad looking. the sheets were hitchy. You can hear the toilet of neighbors.. Im really sorry to give such a bad review because the people there are really nice but the hotel is absolutely not worthy 80$ a night.,4
 The bedsheet was not washed. Pillows had dirt and hair of other people. Room smelled bad. This is during Coronavirus times. I would never go this place again.,3
very good location beautiful panorama helpful staff You can see from the window the best ice cream-shop in the world. :-) wifi is very weak,9
Welcoming staff at the desk were lovely. Family room was a lovely size and split so that it felt like you had your own section. Lovely view of the river and parking directly opposite the hotel. Staff at breakfast made us feel rushed even though we arrived 30 mins before breakfast was finished. We would recommend going earlier for breakfast as at that time there was limited selection as it was not being restocked. Light sleepers should be aware that the internal plumbing can be heard when the toilet is flushed/shower started. ,7.5
Very close to downtown quiet location. Parking was plentifull Bbq restaurant was fine. Rooms were clean. Very very basic room. Just a bed tv closet and bathroom. And soaps. That was it. Ive been in cheaper hotels with more complimentary items in the room such as tea or coffee. Lots of signs with rules and warnings. ,6.7
The staff were super and the location was great. ,10
Great location very close to both the city centre and nature located on a dead-end street so its quiet and peaceful. The breakfast is amazing! ,8
Perfect location very central. Basic room but comfortable There was a shared bathroom rather than a private bathroom per room. This was not a major problem since it was clean and we never had to wait but I do not remember seeing anything on the literature about the shared facilities when I completed my booking.,8.8
 The guy charged us 77 for this room instead of 65 that I booked it for via booking.comThe bedsheet was not washed. Pillows had dirt and hair of other people. Room smelled bad. This is during Coronavirus times. I would never go this place again. ,3
 It was extremely dirty we had spider webs in the room sticky floor stained decorative blanket the towels provided had holes in them and what seemed like black mold on the sealing near the shower.,4.6
the restaurant serves really good food. the owner is a very nice guy. we had no view from our window in the room.,8
Perfect location with nice family rooms.  ,9
Rooms were clean location was excellent More light in the room more plug points in the room there was no kettle in the room,5
Excellent breakfast Very professional staff ready to help to get your preferred room if you already went at this hotel. ,9.2
Bath a bit high to get out of otherwise good comfortable room Would have like more coffee and some tea available in the room,7.5
good location spacious room good beds good breakfast friendly personnel I had trouble sleeping because of noises on the street,9.2
Excellent service friendly receptionist exceptionally good variety breakfast close to everything in city centre i.e. shopping beach restaurants pleasant pool Pool could be better cleaned,9.5
 It wasnt clean there was mold rust and generally in need of repairs & deep-cleaning. ,3.8
 ,9.6
Breakfast comfort in the roomquiet place Bathroom equipment of poor quality  reception personnel has a  lack of qualification,7.1
Great location very close to the beach and shopping streets. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby as well. Very friendly and attentive staff. The breakfast was good many things to choose from. The hotel has been recently renovated but in our room there were many things that were not in top shape - bathroom door could not be closed and handle was falling off. The mattress was not comfortable it was very thin. The hotel is located in a pedestrian zone so you cannot access it directly by car which makes it difficult to unload and load your car especially challenging when you have a small child with you.,6
Croissants was actually very nice location very good. Hotel advertises they have parking only when I got to the hotel I was told I had to book and I have to park in public car park 5 minutes away and pay 22 euros per day. It was quiet upsetting when I looked at the booking email and found it at the very bottom of long email I had to pre-book in advance booked this hotel because it said has parking :(. Also hotel says is 4 stars sorry but thats not true fairly 3 stars. Room needs a refurbishment clean corridors and lift.,6
Best of everything in the center of the town short stroll to the beach and shopping around the corner.Staff is professional and very friendly.Best breakfast and nice dining. ,9.6
Everything The stains on the floor in the room because of other customers .. .,9
the little swimming pool the international standard of everything the lobby like a passage to nowhere the bedroom so grey the invisibility of the sea so close and the too high price.,5
Clean and friendly No real bar and restaurant was closed,7.1
The swimming pool and sauna in the basement were a great place to relax! Very good breakfast with a wide choice. Helpful staff. Noise from the lift during the night. Bright flashing red lights from the smoke detector. Heavy quilt too hot.,9.2
The staff could not do enough for us. Wonderful rooms and wonderful service! Nothing,10
The man who welcomed us at the hotel reception was very friendly and professional. Also one waiter at the restaurant while dining. Poor sound insulation of our room poor food at the dinner industrial breakfast and very very depressing lighting in the hotel the restaurant and in our suite. Staff not well trained besides 2 great guys.,2
Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel.  Perfect location right in the heart of Maaseik.  I always stay here when I am visiting old friends from when I used to live in the city. Ill be back! Nothing at all.  Everything was perfect,7.5
I booked a double bed not two single beds together all night I was falling inbetween the two beds didnt get a good sleep also booked a bath and shower only got a shower but staff were friendly I would come back to this hotel again no problen I booked a double bed not two single beds together all night I was falling in between the two beds didnt get a good sleep also booked a bath and shower only got a shower but staff were friendly I would come back to this hotel again no problen also i ordered Coffee for one I could not say if it was coffee or tea that I got it was ???,6.7
Great bedroom space with an impressive bathroom facing the square.staff were excellent bar and restaurant very relaxing great breakfast. ,9.2
Location is good . Nice big room not spotless clean old bed not comfort to standerd 2019Old towels in bathroom .Breakfast is ok .,6.3
Very comfortable room The toilet there is a stain dont clean good,9.2
Very comfortable sofa spacious room and good design Nothing,9.6
The decor was lovely. The lighting in the bathroom was poor and there was nowhere to put a toilet bag no shelves etc.  The room had no air conditioning so it was very hot.  There was no restaurant breakfast was delivered to my room at 9am.  The breakfast was very simple and basic.  I had requested gluten and lactose free and both were catered for.,5
Staff room service parking just near the enter - all was great  We spent 2h to fill jacuzzi with water but it was fun)),10
Wonderful room. Good in-room breakfast. Comfortable bed.The hotel is in a quite district of liege few km away from the city center.Well definetely come. Back !  No elevator,9.2
Really nice hotel big rooms with sofa and big TV. Bathroom with big shower. Parking for free in front of the hotel. Hotel is more for couples.. ,9.6
 The property smelled strongly of acrid cigarette smoke. They tried to cover it up in the room with strong air freshener but it was still terrible. Loud crashing sounds throughout the night. Cleanliness not great.,3
First see comments of what we didnt like. So after overcoming the unease the extras (in our case a sauna within the room) was actually quite a bonus. You can book a simple breakfast for 10$ per person (delivered to your room). Its a bit out of the way for meals (at night especially if you do not know the town yet). As mentioned by another commenter it would have been good if it was clear that this is hotel for couples to meet for discreetly for sex. (We were passing through & most hotels near the highway were not available. And were a little uncomfortable with the kinky deco. Of course after overcoming the unease everything was clean & OK),7.5
It was very trendy very friendly staff Maybe a bit too expensive with adding the costs for breakfast and taxes,9.2
deco interior and terrace areas. complimentary hand sanitisers to take the cupboard and closet of our room smell and cant even use them. while the room is beautiful but it is not maintained accordingly.,5
Lovely ambience spotless relaxing . Wouldve liked to be able to access coffee & tea sachets  guy on duty didnt know where they where & couldnt use coffee machine behind the bar .It was after 11 at night think they may just be able to leave them on reception with a gratuity dish for payment,9.6
The decorationcleanliness and staff. The douche cabin and the whole bath unit was open midden in the room with no doors!!!,7.9
Nice personnel breakfast - egg of choice! Price bit high for basic room,7
Very friendly staff and an awesome restaurant where we had a lovely dinner on our first night.  Good location and a quiet room We had problems with our shower as it went from hot to cold unexpectedly.  The hot water did come back on after turning off the water for a bit.,8.3
We went on bike weekend and this hotel has great facilities for safe storage of the bike and the possibility to charge the battery of your e-bike in this storage room. Bathroom is rather small but ok for a short stay.,9
Beautiful warm cozy design comfortable clan room nice breakfast  Cant remember,10
Comfortable good size family room.  Very good breakfast International buffet.  Room just needs a full body mirror. Good location nice hotel. ,9
Lovely staff 1. Noise: Noise from the street water noise from other rooms2. Shower: Water sprays to your face and not to top of your hat3. Location: Not the prettiest in Brussels4. 2 type of pillows both not comfortable5. Every-time you enter the room tv turns on. Why? Why should i touch it everytime to turn it off?,5
The room was a bit small but was very cozy  - scandinavian design and  very clean. Bed was comfortable. A minus - there is no closet to put the clothes like jackets and shoes. The location is quite far from city center/important attractions of Brussels (e.g. Grand Place)  approx 17/20 min walking even from the Gare Midi - 3 stops by subway.  For shoppaholics hotel is near one of the biggest streets of luxury shopping like LV Tiffanys and others.,9.6
Amazing staff - gave great recommendations and booked a local restaurant which was fantastic. Great value for money. Feel like we were just unlucky as the drainage in our bath room smelled bad. Bathroom looked very nice though. Asked to change room but was fully booked. Also had dirty sheets which had to be changed.,7.5
The hotel was beautiful and has a wow factor foyer area which is very inviting and cosy.   Our room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The unique bathroom tiles were a nice extra touch and the shower was really good.  Staff were very friendly and more than happy to help with any requests.  We didnt have the breakfast there but it did look good from what we saw. There was some drilling going on when we checked in which was a little off-putting especially as we hadnt been notified of it but as we were out and about this didnt bother us too much.  Although in a nice area we were a bit further from the tourist area/main attractions (25min walk) so bear that in mind for your stay ideally we would have been a bit closer but there is a metro station close by.,8.8
The lobby was nice The room was very essential. I like Scandinavian minimalism but the room was too Spartan. There should be a difference between minimalism and Formule 1 budget hotels,5.8
 The room in the top of the building was like a sauna in the heatwave.,5
Beautiful cozy hotel with a lovely vibe. The colours and decor are all calming and very modern. Loved the area of the hotel great restaurants nearby and accessible to everywhere but a bit of the tourist trap We had single beds and also the shower was too powerful to face down and could therefore only be held in hand,10
 The smell in the bathroom was very unpleasant.,7.1
The Hotel has a very nice architecture with really nice rooms in a renovated old building. The staff is friendly  and the coffee is great as well. BUT the hotel has no air condition which is normally no problem in Brussels but during these days in June the temperature in the room is above 25C! If you open the window it is almost impossible to sleep. Even if it is a side street it seems that people drive races in the road. Additionally a lot of loud people pass during the night. This means a no go for summer. A real pity as I liked the hotel style. I had also last morning a baguette which was so dry that I assume it was at least one day old..,6.3
Stylish interior great location very cozy atmosphere. Small things: too few clothes hangers in the room coffee machine was out of milk scrambled egg all gone when I was at the buffet.,8.3
It was everything the name suggests and more as it wasnt only very comfy and warm but also practical an extra power socket or USB charging socket at desk would have been a bonus,9.2
The hotel is well situated close to the shopping area. The size of the room is more than satisfactory and the design of the hotel is super chic. There is a smell of not used in the bathroom coming from the sewage. Maybe they should try to fix that for guests.,8.8
I booked this hotel for my parents who came to Brussels to visit me and my partner. They were very satisfied with the hotel. They loved the interior decoration of this hotel and also enjoyed the breakfast. They were happy with their room but just one thing that the isolation was too good that it was very hot when the window was open. (Outside was much cooler than the inside to give you a better idea.) Luckily the hotel offered a fan but my parents told me that it was still a bit hot there. (They are Koreans who are more used to having A/C everywhere.) Plus when they opened the window they heard lots of car noise at night although the neighborhood is very nice.,10
The location and style of the lobby I was on 3rd floor and elevator goes to the second then you have to take the stairs. Not easy when you have luggage. Then there is no AC and 3rd floor is particularly hot. If you open the window there are mosquito,6.5
Nice boutique hotel well located for access to the metro Gare Midi (Eurostar) and nearby good bars and restaurants. Room was a good size and clean. No evening meals available at the hotel limited bar choices - the breakfast is OK but nothing special for the money - there is better value to be had in cafes nearby.,7.9
Beautiful decor and a great location to walk from. It was quiet and the staff were very helpful and attentive. The bed was a little too firm for my taste.,9.2
Loved the simplistic room design and decor! ,9.5
 The staff was never behind the front desk and there was no way to call them,6.7
breakfast was quite good the bed was very uncomfortable,6
Its a new hotel with limited facilities. Its a badly designed hotel. Rooms are too small for a 3 star property. The family room we booked was on 5th floor but the elevator was up to 4th floor only. The room was so hot and there was no A/c. It was impossible to carry all our luggage to the top. When asked the hotel staff gave us a double room on 1st floor which was very small and there was no window for the room. The receptionist was kind enough to give us a fan which as per him is the best fan in Brussels. It made a motor running sound but there was no use of it. ,5.4
Great value and great location situated outside the city but walking distance (1 min ) to Louisa Avenue a famous shopping district. but it will take you 20 mins to walk to Grand Place. the bedroom is nice and the bed is comfy ! the shower over the bath when u hang the shower head water squirts everywhere literally i had to use 2 towels to wipe the water all over the bathroom floors later on i had to sit on the edge of the bath and slowly shower floors still wet but not as bad as when u hang it up . the bath glass door needs to widen to prevent water coming out,9.2
 The room doesnt clean yet till 5 clock staff didnt help us to do something better and we have to leave my baggers inside the room while housekeeping clear the room. And when come back we find out The room was no air con so hot we have to change the room at midnight. The Manager so bad doesnt help anything never contact us to do something better.,2.9
Very pleasant hotel in ALL regards. Very much to recommend! Nothing,9
Very clean nice bathroom delicious breakfast and great location (close to the European Parliament etc). The staff is very friendly. The room is very tiny and almost has no window. Feels a bit cramped.,8.3
Breakfast is correct but not exceptional.  The personal is friendly and polite The design is modern and nice There is no air conditioned. For a 3 stars hotel which charges you 170 Euros/night it is totally unacceptable. In summer (my stay was in June)  you have to sleep with the windows opened and there is some noise in the streets.  I was also disappointed when I arrived there was only one person at the reception who does everything (bar tender answers to the phone receptionist). I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my room key... Here again for that category of hotel and associated price you expect a better service for your money.,4.2
Good location just 20 minutes walk to all major landmarks. Good array of shops near the hotel. Clean room they changed the towels on a daily basis. Good breakfast although they tend to close it at 10 sharp. There is a big problem because the hotel does not have air conditioning and if you are going in summer end of June and beginning of July you will receive only a portable fan which is insufficient. So for this price and a little extra pay I could have stayed in a 4 star hotel with AC. It is sad because the hotel was recently renovated and they should have taken this aspect into account.,7.1
Great breakfast beautiful bathroom minimalist design. Its probably way too minimalist there was not even a glass in the bathroom to have some water. ,6.3
 it was so noisy in the mornings the rooms are pretty small no kettle in the room or anywhere else in the hotel in the end it doesnt worth the price.,6.7
 There was not hot water in the room and I was not told about this on arrival. Not great when you are on a business trip. The staff did not say there is an issue - the guests had to ask why the water is not on and where it will be back.,5.5
That was great nice hotel good location nice staff. ,10
The Hygge Hotel is a lovely modern hotel with a homely feel to it. Staff were friendly and accommodating. No noise throughout the night. Breakfast had lots of different options to suit all. All round lovely hotel and would stay again. Everything was good.,9.6
Coffee machine in the room and water will be good. 5th floor apartment need to go on stairs with your luggage and cold morning from one building to other not perfect as well. Lift was broken so I had to carry luggages with my family. Make sure you avoid booking rooms on 5th floor Too hot - radiators off. No lift to my apartment. No water coffee mahone in room. Broken lift. Staff didnt offer anything after found out about lift.,6
Beautiful and quiet great location. Friendly staff. ,9
The breakfast was really nice and they had a lot to chose from. The room was nice and clean so was the bathroom. Whenever I spoke to staff all were friendly. In regards to breakfast initially I found it a bit difficult to find cutlery or get the coffee machine working. When asking a member of staff for help they were happy to do so but I did experience better customer/guest service.,7.9
Location is suitable if you have car - we didnt use public transport so i cant say about it. Staff is friendly  breakfast is perfect for this budget. Rooms is super small for 2 persons there is no air condition but windows open keep temp ok ( sep)   Mattress is thin - not that comfort,8
Quiet location Metro station only a few minutes walk. ,7
Easy to access from highway good parking (not so expensive 10 euros) and really close to the metro station that brings you to city center in 15 to 20 min. ,8.3
Already the 3rd time I stay at this hotel. Everything OK but I let my car outside the parking: 10$ for 83$ (price of the room) is too much for me!,8
Design Small hardly got space for luggages,8.3
It was important for us to find a hotel with parking facilities and Ibis Erasmus was the winner. Close the metro station that take you to the city center in less than 20 min. Great choice if you arrive with a car. ,7.9
I stayed in April with my family we love the hotel. Location was good the rooms were clean and stuff was nice. Air conditioner was not working,8.3
Location near metro station not so expensive parking comfortable bed No air conditioning mosquitoes could be in your room if you sleep with open window ,7.5
Location was ideal as right next to Metro station that takes you straight into the centre of Brussels within 20/30mins. Got a shopping centre not too far away either. Could do with a little sound proofing. Could practically hear neighbours breathe.,8.8
Breakfast was OK location convenient a few minutes walk from a metro station. Difficult access.  This is outside the control of the hotel but major works at the metro station made it very difficult to access the hotel,7.5
The location is a bit far from the city but well connected with metro line. Nearby eateries are less during the night which might be a hassle. But the hotel provides pizza with toppings of our choice for Euro 12.50 even during midnights. The area is calm and quiet. For people with private vehicle can visit Hallerbos during spring season which is just 20 - 25 mins away by drive. The area is very near the highway sections. The beds were irritating. We had requested one double bed but the mattresses were in such a way that there was a huge gap between us. we had to keep pushing the mattresses all the time inside the bed frame which was a real bother in the nights.,7.5
friendly staff. close to a metro station. being overcharged twice for the same drinks in the hotel bar.,7.5
The hotel was nice and clean and really close to a metro station. It couldve been closer to the city (it was right next to the last station on the metro line).,8
The staff was very friendly and it had a good location! A dead fly sticked at our ceiling.,8.3
Price was very good and the all-you-can-eat restaurant nextdoor was excellent. Beds are a tad too hard but still OK for a few nights. The ventilation ran all night which was rather noisy and we could hear other rooms partying through it. Room didnt heat up very well. Could have been a defect in our room only though.,6.3
Good and quiet location friendly staff at the reception. Small room in my opinion proper for 1 person. I stayed for 3 nights and on the 2nd day nobody went to clean the room. Because I just arrived at the hotel about midnight and tired I did not say anything at the reception. The hotel needs to invest in pillows the ones I had were really bad.,6.7
Ok as a quick stop over if nothing else available. Room was tiny bed was so uncomfortable and the pillows were of no use at supporting your head. Had to use rolled up towels!,5
It is 300 meters from my office Free parking Just good,8
Nice room and breakfast. Its little bit far from the center.,8.3
Staff are very helpful and polite You get what you pay for here. Staff are great the bed is hard with a very thin matress and basic dated bathroom. Great for a sleep only overnight stay. Taxis are very very expensive. 30 euros for a 10 minute journey to the market ,6
Everything was perfect. And I will always choose this particular hotel whenever I want to relax from home. Big ups guys. U always have my recommendations.  Keep going Loved almost everything there,8
 Small dirty rooms need improvement first room had broken bunk bed and missing screws needs closing down,3.3
You get what you pay for basic room and facilities with a great bed. 10min walk from the bus and 20min walk from the tram. Budget friendly hotel for families or for a quick stop. The location.,9.2
Quaiet place Small simple room old furniture. Really Budget hotel. Next day I moved to Novotel next to this hotel.,5.4
Great value for the price. Easy to access. Incomplete door on toilet was not the best for smells.,7.5
 what are these toilet doors?! no privacy at all,5.8
The priceThe staff is great There was a stinky smell in the douche in one of the two roomsReally cold in the two rooms,7.5
It was in quite and calm place It was average hotel,5
The beds were very comfortable and the shower was excellent. There was enough parking. The carpet had a stain and the breakfast wasnt what wed expected. There was also some miscommunication when picking up our breakfast in the morning. That was a bit unfortunate.,8
Quiet & clean as expected good for parking  ,7.1
very close to Tesla superchargers Aircondition  not sufficient  very warm in room,7
No electrical sockets anywhere near the bed no mini fridge but very quiet clean good beds pillows blankets. Breakfast was good. ,9.2
Ok for an overnight stop A little out of the way but we knew that so not necessarily a complaint.,7.1
Location Not enough power sockets in the room. In fact there was only 1 which was far away from the bed. In this day and age there should be several power sockets for laptop phone tablet.Also there was no desk.,10
 The room was non-smoking however when wr arrived in the room the smell of sigarettes was like someone just smoked there 5 minutes ago. I was with a child of 3 years so i really didnt like that. but for the price we paid i cannot complain,7.5
Even though I checked in shortly after midnight the guy at the desk was very friendly and professional. The room was clean and nice breakfast was ok. ,7.5
Location is good The bed was not nice (needs a new matras).,7.9
Free parking and decently clean Too much plastic surfaces and location quite far from any other places,6.3
Good and easy booking in. Pleasant and helpful staff. Good variety of choice for breakfast. It was good value for money. No complaints! Found the facilities and staff very acceptable and superior in many ways to the standard Ibis hotels!,8.3
Good value for money. Very conveniently located for my business. Restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance. Friendly staff. Free parking and WiFi. Quiet area even close to the Port of Antwerpen. Considering the hotel type and associated rate nothing.,7.9
Late Checkout on sunday Till 5 pm. Good price helpful stuff.  The rooms were as expected but a bit over time which you could der in furniture. The hotel is outside the City which wasnt a big Deal so WE could save City Car Tax but a huge Problem was the Public Transport. The Bus fromm hotel is only every hour the Tram about 2km feetwalk. ,6
Free parking clean room.  The room did not have an actual bathroom. There was a sink inside one door with the toilet (which couldnt be locked) and another door with the shower. The mattress was hard and not comfortable. I booked a room with a double bed but was sent to a room with a full bed and a top bunk. Housekeeping personnel entered inside the room in the early morning before we checked out. ,5.4
was clean Very tight on space pillows very thin and lumpy not even a drinking water bottles in room. Like a youth hostel.,5.4
Great value.Everything one might need for a one night pit stop.Staff very friendly and breakfast was ace. ,10
it was open and the receptionist was nice very thin blanket. uncomfortable bed just nasty,5
Everything The weather. It was raining,10
The staff were incredible. Could not fault them what so ever. We had to cut our stay short due to needing to head home to Australia early because of COVID-19 outbreak. The staff helped us so much with anything they could to make our experience better. Thank you! Also- Our first room had a broken window they moved us straight away. The rooms were clean and tidy.  The property was quite far out from the city centre and restaurants and other shops etc. Public transport in the area was often unreliable but thats not the properties fault. ,8
 Price is on the level of 3 stars hotel but unfortunately this is one stars hotel. Booked it because needed someplace to sleep the same day I booked. its clean and ok to sleep one night but I felt discomfort everywhere :( Toilet shower 2-level bad under my bad.. I dont like it felt like Im in hospital.,6.5
Due to CORONA breakfasts are simple but good. Quite small space in the room,7
Free Bathroom Amenities and Towel rarely found in Budget Hotel.Staff is really nice. The Wi-Fi is enough too. The shower is literally in the bedroom. Its beside your bed and theres a hole in the bathroom if you are not careful the water will splash to your room.The location isnt exactly in Antwerp best if you are bring a car because the parking lot is huge.,7.5
There was a big restaurant just next 2 the hotel.So easy to grab a bite  The matras was a bit hard  and thin you could feel the plank under it ,7.1
Terrace in front hotel Bothering from one receptionist about the masks panic and spreading rummors of covid situation as a dramatic,7
Good for an overnight stop when travelling long distanced I arrived late at night and checked in with no problems. Although the location is close to the motorway (for me the main attraction a good overnight stop before continuing my journey) there isnt much else nearby - it is quite far from any tourist attractions.,10
Price breakfast cleanliness Nothing,9.6
 Extreme smell of cigarette smoke in the entire room.,6.3
Standard ibis budget in industrial area. Free parking. ,7.1
The most friendly and smiling staff I ever meet. Only few things available during breakfast but their quality was excellent. Location - every shop restaurant bar etc. are located far away.,7.1
 Each room had cigrette smell. I would not recommend for non smokers.,3.3
The staff atention It was a water leak in the toilet. Everything else was excelence,8
the staff were friendly rooms are clean and the breakfast buffet was something for everyone. ,10
Price of the room was great very clean and the staff were very friendly and polite.Accommodating to the dog too so pet friendly.Breakfast was great not a wide selection but still good for first thing in the morning. ,8.8
Nothing Breakfast was pathetic. Just bread bread bread. And a bad tasting apple juice.please refund my money.,4.6
Staff were very friendly and helpful !!!! ,9.6
Clean good easy location available off road and garage parking ($)Though breakfast cost was high until we had the breakfast very good and extensive range even make your own waffle iron and auto egg boiling with specific timers - definitely a fabulous breakfast !!  Personally like a small kettle to make a coffee but was no problem really,9.6
 The towels en the bed. The towels where way to fast wet. En the bed was really bad because it didnt had any ventilation.,6.3
Location No coffee or tea facilities in our room,6.3
Stayed for the week-end. We were on the courtside therefore it was calm. The room was spacious. The breakfast was good but quite expensive.,7
 Sorry to say wot we payed for breakfast it was rubbish wont be staying there again,9.2
Location. No hand towels in room. No kettle or tea/coffee making facilities. Cost of tea/coffee at reception was too much. Breakfast was poor - no cereal other than granola. Only scrambled eggs or boiled eggs were the hot options. No staff around to clean crumbs from tables & chairs or restock food. Cost of parking too much ($20 a night is expensive).,4
Good location. Tidy rooms. Breakfast was plenty. All in all good value for money. No idea why someone thought it was a good idea to start moving furniture in the morning in an adjacent room. Probably the cleaning crew. Some soft sliders underneath the legs might do the trick.,7.5
we liked the Location very close to restaurants and businesses. The rooms were very small specially the shower my partner is 2m and had a difficult time getting around or showering,8
the location was superb as it is close by  and within walking distance to many attractions. the room was nice although very small but had all we needed. the staff were friendly and helpful with information about the town and our trains from Gent there is limited space in front of the toilet.,7.9
Location and cleanliness of the room. Noise from the neighbors. Thin walls. Noise from the early morning from the construction next to our window.,7
very handy located in the centre of Gent breakfast was medium (savery / ham etc and jam tasted poor as well as the coffee),7
it was all pretty good the room was basic but clean the shower was powerful and had a late checkout time too soaps and shampoo could be better bed wasnt terribly comfortable but ok,8.8
Great location very close to the centre of Ghent. Excellent breakfast. Good service. Rooms are quite small but theyre fine for a short stay.,8
Friendly staff w excellent location The room was cramped especially the toilet,6
The location is excellent. The bed was comfortable. This Ibis is very very old and needs renovating.,5
Fantastic location super friendly staff A little bit overprices for a very small room but again the location is very central!,8
Location (+ good connection to the railway station) quite good breakfast No fridge and quite small amount of plugs in the room,8.3
It is an excellent location in the very heart of Gent. Breakfast is good. The room is quite small.,8.8
Location is good. Staff is nice. I have booked a superior room and I ended up in one room looking nothing like the pictures. It was extremely small. If that was the superior I cannot imagine how the standard look like.I feel I ended up not getting what I paid for! ,6.3
rooms ok for one person. excellent mattress . clean room. one towel per person is at least rediculous!!!!,7.9
The parking used to be included in this hote its not now they want $26 a day which is a  disgrace. Alternate parking is half a mile away. Also hotel looking tired See above,4
Right next to St. Baaf! And walking distance to major attractions. Staff are friendly & room is clean.  Will be back if Im to visit Gent again Nothing,9.6
The staff was super nice accomodating our requests for additional pillows/sheets. Beautiful view from our 5th floor room on Gents roofs and cathedrals! Room was a little too hot definitely too warm for the provided comforter. Bathroom is tiny!,7
The staff was amazingly kind and generous. We went in a period were the covid restrictions were very limited and we still managed to have our breakfast at our room. Also the underground parking is a plus. We took a premium room because of the bath but in the end the bath was so tiny that a grown up could not enjoy it.  We had a nice view of the church but combined with a tram passing just next to our window. ,7
I have stayed in this hotel several times it has a great location and staff is always friendly. Even with the COVID regulations the breakfast was really good. ,9
Amazing position The room was EXTRIMELY small.I was told my room would not have been cleaned due to Covid-19 restrictions. To get a clean room I would have had to change the room and I could do that as many times as I wanted. This also applies to towels and toilet paper. However after three days I asked to change my room and then they just sent the cleaning service. It seems only a cheap excuse not to clean the room. Moreover the breakfast buffet could be considered way more dangerous since people are touching food and stuff.,6
Central location great room and plentiful breakfast buffet ,10
Close to the airport with shuttle service A little bit more smiling personel,7
Start booking with breakfast include when get there is not included this second time happened with booking .com ,3.3
 We were shoved in a room that smelled of smoke - I was traveling with my young children and we arrived at night.  Even though we booked a twin room we got two tiny beds next to each other in a really tiny room.. upon complaining the check in guy came and moved the beds 6 inches apart to make it a twin room.  Just ridiculous.   The room had no amenities not even drinking water.  I was told that this is the standard Ibis affair and he claimed to have seen 13 other Ibis locations - I might have my doubts since I have stayed at various Ibis hotels as well. Stay away - far better and cheaper options available near the airport than this junk!,3.8
 I paid City tax twice. Once when i booked on Booking.com and second time on p≈Çace at the reception desk.,5
 the flushing system in the toilette did not work very well,8
 Paid wifi.. In 2021 and with this type of hotel it should be only free wifi with enough bandwidth!,9
Bed was good air conditioning to high but coulcc dc be adjusted For short stay okclean and comfortable no other problem,8
The location is excellent very close to the Airport and NATO HQ. The room was cozy and clean the staff was extremely helpful and cooperative. I appreciate the free bottle of water offered by the Hotel. I woudl really recommend it for short staying in Evere. Nothing special to report.,9
The bed was very good Very far from Brussel center and the public transportation was not very good from and to the hotel,5
Price front desk night guy was nice  Hallways smelled of cigarettes even though there were signs saying no smoking in hallways. People yelling outside room sounded like drug deals going on down the hall with people yelling throughout the whole night even as we were leaving at 4 am Parking cost even though there was no security to insure safety of car  ,4.6
Breakfast had a good choise in particular there was fresh orange juicy (to be made by yourself) and there was the possiblity to prepare your own  waffles. The hotel also has the shuttle service to/from the airport. It is really close to line 272 stop to go i and out of the city centre. THe elevator was noisy: if you have a room close to it that can be annoying,7.9
Quietness Confusion with the tax payments,7
Breakfast was not included. We had breakfast at the airport. The room was the size of a prison cell and decorated like one (not). The odor of disinfectant was soooo strong it gave us a headache and we had to leave the room.,5.4
I dont like the service which they provide for me The staff is useless no water and the location is worst,3
Nothing the staff was very rude The man at the reception was very rude and let me pay for parking without staying there  for 3 hours,1
The shuttle to & from the central train station was convenient for our travels.The room was clean & what we expected. ,7.5
Hotel staff made a note of our request to have rooms on same floor. Check in was easy. All staff are very nice and helpful. Breakfast was OK lots of choice but at $15 it should be. Hotel is 10 min journey by taxi cost $16 as our flight arrive in the afternoon and shuttle bus only starts again at 6pm. Rooms are a bit tired and could do with a re vamp.  Rooms noisy even with the extra door shut over. I was in 110 which is right above the front door so also has the added noise of people getting on the shuttle bus.,8
Great place to stay when you wait for your flight ,8
Quiet surrounding Hotel services limited due to pandemy. Room has a smell of a cigaretes bathroom shower showing a sign of a heavy exploitation. Parking fee,5.8
The crew was very amiable. The breakfast was excellent. The free shuttle to te airport very convenient. ,8
Needed a basic hotel room for a night near the airport that allowed dogs to stay and this was a perfect fit. Very friendly and welcoming staff a nice funky feel and the added bonus was nearby corn field that was perfect for walking the dog in!  ,9.2
just to warn other travellers. when you book the hotel pay attention to the name of airport you are arriving to/ departing from) there are 2 of them in Brussels.. and really far from each other) so dont make the same mistake I did)) mixing the airports and than travelling for almost 3 hours to the hotel)) ,7
6am breakfast They did not have an iron!,8
Near the airport. Free shuttle bus to airport. ,9.2
The breakfast the bathrooms smelt so badly I had to change rooms and still had the same smell in bathrooms. I think it is a health hazard at this point.,1
Breakfast was good. Room comfortable. Reception taking ¬£5 tax off me when it was already paid,5
The room was very comfortable and the transport to and from the airport very convenient. The room was not very clean there was a dirty towel in the bathroom and I found hair on the floor.,8.8
Very good breakfast though enough parking and close to bus connection downtown. Somewhat worn out and room did not seem completely clean. And was quite small.,5
large rooms limited time schedule for bus shuttles,8
Breakfast is very delicious The staff at the reception are not giving enough information,6.7
Close to the Bourget area and close to the airport Hotel is ok - small fridge would be nice,8.3
During covid times so not the full hotel experience. Great location - only 10 minutes drive from the Airport. Facilities look good although restaurant was closed due to lockdown. Plenty of onsite parking charged at 12Euro per night  A takeaway breakfast was catered for although nothing too fancy. ,8
very kind personnel. Clean room comfortable bed very well equipped bathroom good WiFi and TV enough storage. At one stones throw from the airport. Due to Covid restrictions they served me a pretty good breakfast to have in the room. Very recommendable. Theres a light smell of cleaning products on the corridors,8.8
The breakfast was very good Twice I was eating meat in the restaurant (spare ribs and chicken) and twice I had to ask for meat that wasnt overcooked /  fried so much that one could not use a knife. The service was great and swift with this but I noticed an issue with cooking meat.. Salmon was ok but again it looks like this process is not going well. In the room I expected a water cooker to make tea. The vending machine didnt accept two euro coins and waiting for a fix took too long.,7
I am not able to find any advantage of this hotel. Whole hotel was little bit dirty. Better to use cheaper hotel ibis few meters next to this one. It is cheaper solution and quality je almost the same. This hotel just hlave aircondition. By it is not worth almost double price as that cheaper one.,4
Friendly staff and very central Airflow in the room was poor but the fan available resolved this,8.8
The location was great. The waiting time in the reception for our chack in was more tha 30minutes. There was no fridge in the room and no AC. There was only a small vendilator that did not work. Overall not a good experience. Would not visit again even though we have stayed in many hotels from Ibis.,3
 excessively hot room. no air-conditioning. no ventilation. windows locked. a basic fan was provided with the room.,5.8
Parking lot inside the building with a attractive parking  fee for hotel guests although can only be paid cash. Nice restaurant across the street.  Generally the standard IBIS. Indoor cycling trainer is located in the middle of the floor corridor in front of all the rooms which is weird. As for those who train but also for people living on that floor. Very dirty hotel entrance the stairway was just covered with cigarette buts. The hotel is located in the same building as the shopping mall with lots of shady people running around at night. Liege is generally not the place you want to visit as a tourist. ,7.1
the breakfast the shower was broken so we have to hold it with one hand during the shower,8
In the very center parkplace across the street Although it was clean it gave an impression of old and dusty,7
Location is the best feature. Friendly staff and helpful.Parking not free but with reduced fee very advantageous. Room very small and a bit old it looked that the WC was renovated but the bedroom no. ,7
In the centre of Liege very comfortable bed and amazing view.  ,10
location value The bedding was bit soft for me  and the power code were not near the bed,8
Fantastic location great value discounted parking and friendly staff! The rooms were incredibly hot and we didnt have the ability to lower the temp or open a window. A fan was provided but it still wasnt enough.,8.3
Clean comfortable room and friendly staff. Very good central location.  The heating was on in the room and could not be turned off so it was too warm in the room.,9.6
I liked the location the staff. The room was very small there was no fridge little bathroom supplies. At breakfast there were no vegetables.,7
Staff were very friendly No fridge on the room carpet looked a little old,7
The location Poor breakfast hardly no greens staff not service minded s tains on the carpet in the room no air condition in the room.,3.8
We did not take the breakfast so I cannot tell. The location of the hotel was good and easy access. Personnel was friendly! ,10
 Bad smell in the room impossible to open the windows also checked with the receptionist no AC to get some fresh air during the night ,7
Convenient location. Nice staff in morning and afternoon shift. Fast check-in/out Evening shift wasnt wearing mask. Carpet had chlorine stains.,7
A kettle would have been lovely just to make a cup of tea ,10
The area clean abd nice rooms We were at the side where we couldnt open the windows and it was such a pitty (understandable why not but still.) otherwise everything was fine,9
The location room was quiet to the backsidebut easy if you cannot open the window No GO: Not possible to get fresh air into the room feels like prison.its very small one person must go out of the bed like crab because the wall is too close to the bed.we are youngbut no option especially for older couples! Breakfast crazy bad :(,4.6
when we arrived and couldnt find the entrance we phoned the reception and the man at the entrance was very friendly and helpfull and we always could go to him for questions or some help overall all the staff in the hotel was very friendly and helpfull the car park is very old and dated but this hasnt to do with the hotel however they could have put signs towards the entrance of the hotel in the car park,8
Good .we enjoyed it but we think that in the price air condition is includ thats the only disappointment if not every thing is fine.thanks ,7
 The cleaning they have to clean better the room . I saw the desk with a coffee stain .,8
 plastic glasses in the bathroom should be replaced in particular as a focus is put on environmental protection.,7
Typical Ibis. Check in easy staff pleasant and capable room comfortable with a good view. Breakfast is usual Ibis affair i.e. better than a youth hostel but not by a long margin. ,8
Best location. Not the best facilities but acceptable.,9
Huge and very comfortable bed! Shower was small but ok.,10
hmmm..MIGHT BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS TRAVERLERS Arriving on an weekend evening location was sketchy even though in the middle of town:,5
Nice room with view. In center of Liege walking distance to many attractions. Parking under the hotel. Breakfast facility was just restarting after being closed for months due to the Covid-19 crisis. Therefore breakfast had to be ordered one day in advance and was mostly prepackaged in a paper bag.,8
Chromecast in the room friendly staff good breakfast great location The pillows werent so good,9
Plenty of eateries to choose from. When we called the hotel to ask about where to park we was put through to the main call centre who told us to park in St Denis.  When we walked to the hotel and checked in we was then made aware the parking garage was directly beneath the hotel with a direct access lift.  This information could be updated to the call centre.,10
Location good The rooms were too hot. No way to drop temperature. Impossible toSleep.,6.7
 The big problem with this hotel is their centrally controlled air con system which did not seem to be working well enough and the windows in our room were hermetically sealed. We were sweltering in this breathless room and couldnt sleep - I had to call reception at about midnight who swiftly moved us to a room where the windows opened. Id never normally complain like this but it was like being suffocated. Big relief and a much better nights sleep (although the new bathroom smelled slightly of smoke!). The hotel is nice clean spacious well located and people are friendly but the temperature control was a total deal breaker. There was also no apology at any stage or explanation. Reception check in was also slow as they only had one person on the desk.,5.4
Really central lots of things to do and see. Loads of restaurants close at hand  All was good no complaints ,10
 Windows wouldnt open and no air con very uncomfortable nights sleep. Not good especially when traveling for work,3
The location is superb. The indoor bathroom is very decent and convenient. Along with overall general facilities and cleanliness. The hostel has youth in its title (and my receipt) but I ended up sharing a room with a 50 years old guy.,8.3
Must eat their breakfast. Worth for money. ,7.9
Good value for the money close to the central station and city center Fungus at the bathroom,8.3
My single room is at the end quiet. Room and bathroom are spacious. Bathroom has shower gel which is better than Sleep Well Hostel.  Breakfast is too simple. That would be nice if there is a bath towel for $57 single  room.,9.2
The breakfast was basic but very nice There was quite a lot of noise outside since our room was at the street side,7
Breakfast location and customer care. I dint like the way i slept with many people  I mean i was Not used,5
It was clean the bedsheets were free breakfast was included. It was quite close to the city Center. Would definitely stay here again  ,8.8
Nice breakfast. The room could be bigger,9.2
 Toilet and shower private but outside the room.,7.9
 The hostel doesnt provide a cover for the quilt so every people staying on the bed use a quilt that has been used by many people without cleaning. My quilt literally smells like PEE I didnt sleep well at night cause I kept smelling disgusting smell from the quilt. It also doesnt even look clean btw just a mess. ,4.6
Location handy for the local bus from the airport. Also about 15 - 20 minutes walk to the centre. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was really nice. Its a bit odd that the toilet is outside the room and around the corner in the case of my room. Only shower in the room. But it was fine.,9
The breakfast was ok the essencial was there for a nice morning meal! the room was not like the pictures so not what we expected but still an ok room for an hostel. We checked in late at nigt and that wasn¬¥t a problem. The hostel is just 20 min walking to the center and 7min by e-bike. If you want a sheep place and you doesn¬¥t matter for the style of the room tis is the place! A person (staff) enter in our room in the morning with out permission and we were naked. He nocked I said Yes and he just opened the door.,6.7
The staff is really friendly and niceLocation is near the train station and flixbus stops as well There is no soap in the bathroom and no toilette in the rooms bathroom so only two toilettes shared by the whole floor. ,8.8
The hostel was easy to find on the map. Located not far from the city centre and main tourist attractions. I was really pleased with variety of food for breakfast. Staff were very friendly and helpful. ,9.2
Decent breakfast- hot drinks etc good shower Not comfiest beds or bedding no air con,8
Good choice they even had juices and sufficient choice of meals. My room was plenty spacious and even had its own wash sink with large mirror. I would prefer if shower room could be locked. Locker size in rooms is too small. The night reception is little unintuitively disguised as a bar.,6
Good hostel for the price. The room is nice and have bathroom inside. Good breakfast included. The location is great - close to the metro station and other attractions just 10 min walk from Noord Station. The bathroom inside the room could be more clean.,7.9
clean and in the city centre. great breakfast as well -,8.3
Staff were friendly Too far from the centre and not enough to do nearby,7.5
They have soymilk and vegan options(margarine marmalade fruits) for breakfast. Breakfast is included and pretty okay for a hostel Check out is easy   It wasnt clean. The trashbin in our room wasnt even emptyCheck in was not really flexible. We waited almost an hour. And then there was a queue But its not expensive Ouh and the beds arent comfortable and there is no elevator but how I already said for the price its okay ,7.1
Breakfast was good the bed was a bit uncomfy it was very well located. Bed wasnt comfortable,7
The breakfast for a youth hostel was really good. Fresh fruits three sorts of jam ham and cheese. The staff was super kind and nice they also have their honest opinion on tours for example which I think is always gold worth! Actually I think I was in one of the oldest rooms of the hostel. The room could have been a bit more clean. There were some hairs from a previous visitor left in the closet. And the one with the blanket is still like this (only a sheet and a normal inlet). If you know it you can arrange and I think that the reason is because of the heat during the summer. So please understand this as a neutral point!  The location might be in the centrum but its still everytime a quick fifteen minute walk so maybe its better for a solo traveller to stay closer inside.,7.9
Location good. Walkable to town centre without being stuck there. Kitchen use limited to specific hours. Could not cook breakfast in morning or make tea after 2200. 4 bed room felt small with 4 adults. Limited indoor places to sit. Bar had loud music so difficult to Skype. Staff variable. excellent to indifferent. Good place for school groups. Terrace will be good in warm weather. Little atmosphere for independent travellers.,7.9
The breakfast was good. Good location easy walk to the Grand Place. Room was big enough. Beds were not very comfortable. A shower curtain would have been useful.,7.9
The location it was near supermarkets bus station. The fact that it had a vending machine with water at 1$. Great deal.  The sheets were a little bit dirty. The people from other rooms were making a lot of noises at night although it was a rule for no noise after 10 PM.  ,7.9
Excellent location great staff very helpful. Would stay again ,9.2
Very tidy room the personnel is really professional and the general building is awesome. Really cheap price cant ask for much more. The plugs in the rooms should be more than one and close to each bed. The breakfast was very basic I suggest including some more types of dishes even with a small fee.,8.3
Reception area and the common bathroom access rooms was very packed and bathroom was not good at all,6.7
The entire hostel had a good atmosphere to it and theres a lot of activities to do (such as air hockey tables). The location was also convenient as theres a metro just 5 minutes away but it was also around a 20 minute walk to the city center anyway.  Breakfast was included in the payment.The staff was really helpful. No Towels included. Have to pay extra to get one.,8
The staff were friendly helpful breakfast was good good location and facilities. Maps given were helpful and good transport links The bathroom has mould in it no foot towels so very slippy and dangerous people were very loud inside and outside. The beds werent made so hard to do this in the evening with everyone asleep very hot in the rooms even with windows open,7.1
Nothing Their elevator didnt work during my trip. The wiffi was weak in my room. They did not cover pillow cloths for us. We had to did by myself. There was not hand washer in my bathroom. Breakfast is poor,4
The room they provided us was reasonably spacious especially the bathroom was good considering my wife was on a wheelchair. Maybe the noise because being a hostel too much of youth were there adding to the bar accessibility on the premises.,9.2
The hostel is very well-located and the staff receptionist is really friendly. After all the problems they gave half of my money back. We didnt have electricity for 14 hours and water for personal care. The staff was available during the day and the night they had only one guy to do everything.,6.7
Room has its own bathroom Rooms are too small,7.1
The location and the breakfast Uncomfortable bed,7.9
They have a bar on the hostel which was really good and the service formidable. also the breakfast was delicious and is included with in the price. The room was really good and the size was great. ,9.2
It was comfortable and clean ... walking distance from the Center - about 20 min .. overall good property Staff could be more helpful..,8.3
Breakfast Unlike the last time I stayed here things have gotten far far worse.Elevator was not working at all no signal of internet in my room had to hang in the hallway (even there it was terrible and losing the signal all the time) no toiletries in the bathroom (soap at least ffs).No early breakfast can be scheduled if departing early.The electricity went out one evening.Showers water pressure was weak and the water not that hot. ,4
Nice rooms big bathroom. There was a table in the room with plenty of chairs which was nice. some places to put your clothes even hangers. Breakfast was good nothing special - cereal and toast there was coffee orange juice - enough to go through the morning. In my room there was no wifi although it worked in all the other rooms. Me and my roommates tried to ask the staff to fix it but they didnt so throughout all of my stay I had no wifi. I think the staff didnt put too much effort into solving our problem bc wifi worked in all the other rooms and that attitude makes me sad. Also take your own lock (costs 4 euros at the reception) and towel its 3 euros to rent it.,5
The work starf were friendly the breakfast is ok the room was clear. Its very nice that the hostel is located next to the river. 1) . I booked it  over one month before I started my journey I did hope I could have the peacful relax juring the stay but they told me I will move to another room after two nights I asked why there were a big travle group will come soon their anwsered. I had to do my packing and checked outbefore 10 am and then checked in after 3 pm that means there were 5 hours out of the servic and my rest time was disturbed rughly I do hope they would have some suitable way later.,8.3
Fair distance to the subway station nice pub with friendly staff big bathroom for the private room Food options are quite limited especially if you arrive in the evening on weekends like we did. The hostel pub only has drinks some little snack would be  useful. The double room gorund floor only has some upper windows if you want some light in then people walking outside could look directly into your bed,7
The bed area was clean and comfortable. The staff was also super helpful. The restroom smelled terrible and was quite dirty. There wasnt even handsoap in the restroom. The shower wouldnt drain either!,4
 No lift to the room on 3-rd floor only narrow stairs,8.8
The staff and the location of the hostel they have laundry services and that was good  Not all the beds have power outlets close to them like other hostels,8
The breakfast was very good but can be improved. It was a male-only room and I am amazed how polite the guys were. That has never happened to me while I am/was staying in a mixed room. Elevator was not working for which I complained and the issue got resolved by the staff. No internet in my room previous time I stayed here there was very fast internet in my room. Only 2 lockers in the room for 4 people.,5
Wi-fi was fast. Toilets and shower inside our room were quite clean. Bathroom had a luxurious feeling compared to the other hostels Ive stayed in. Sheets were clean too. Matresses and pillows were not that comfortable. Breakfast menu felt a bit poorer can be improved.,7.9
Its was nice and clean and was busy place. They dont have sockets for individuals.,5.4
Location was very good.  Breakfast was reasonable and satisfying. The mattress was terrible.  Couldnt get comfortable.  It was like sleeping on a flat board. No accomodation made for those with bad backs.   It would have been nice if there was better lounge facilities if you wanted to take a day to rest from traveling.  The furniture in the lobby although stylish is not conducive to relaxation.  It is too low to the ground and not meant for comfort.  The chairs in the dining room again not good for posture. They were meant for style and esthetics.   For hostel travelers when entering room at midnight dont flip on lights. Please adhere to lights out at 10pm.  I can not begin to tell you the inconsiderate nature of fellow travelers during my  stay.,4
Helpfull staff great location just 15 min from the city center bar downstairs. Breakfast didnt give a lot of choices but ive enjoyed it  Bathroom and its cleanliness the basin faucet needs descaling same for the shower faucet. Ceiling requires attention there are dark places all over looks like some kind of that unhealthy fungus is growing there.,7.9
Facilities of the hostel the possibility to use the kitchen and having breakfast. I asked for an invoice in my companys name I had to basically write the details myself because they had already printed out the invoice and it coudnt be changed. The room was not quiet and it smelled a little.,7.1
Very spacious Room Advertised Breakfast as from 7 am but there was nobody there so we had to leave to Airport without the Breakfast we paid for.,8
Breakfast was ok Had to buy the towelsSeparate shower and toilet,5
The room itself was outstanding. Really stunning. Two floors with a private bathroom and sitting area. Electricity kept tripping in the room meaning had to charge phones in the morning and wasting a lot of time hanging around. Also in the self catered kitchen facilities were poor and limited. Im sad to leave bad feedback because the room its self was stunning,8
Personal including breakfast excellent situated from center and subway free travel map Dirty bathroom,7
The entire hostel had a good atmosphere to it and theres a lot of activities to do (such as air hockey tables). The location was also convenient as theres a metro just 5 minutes away but it was also around a 20 minute walk to the city center anyway. There was a separate shower and toilet for the room I booked so I could easily maintain the cleanliness. Breakfast was included in the payment and it generally had more choices than other breakfasts Ive had in hostels. They also allow to store luggage after check out so you can still roam around before you leave the city.  The toilet generally smelled really funky so it was good that the toilet and shower were separate. ,9
The girl in the reception was nice and give us information.  The hotel was clean and tide. Breakfast was really good and you can choose a lot of good drinks and things to eat. We came back on Sunday 20.30hs and there was no one at the reception. The elevator was out of service so we have to go up till the 3er floor with our luggage by the stairs. To have to make your own bed.  It doesnt include towels (only one for the hands) nor soap for hands.  The tap of the sink gave me electricity when I touch it.,5
 The bathrooms should have been cleaner. Hand soap was not provided.,7
Hostel was really clean and I really enjoyed the accommodation at all.  I also liked that the hostel is situated near metro station and the city centre as well.. ,10
Clean and friendly Our room overlooked the courtyard meaning it was extremely noisy at night and in the morning. We were also the room next door to the dining room which meant yet again that it was extremely noisy and busy outside our room early in the morning. Other than that the room and hostel in general was clean and the staff were friendly. The location was slightly poor. A good 20 min walk into the centre which wasnt fun in the wind and rain. Metro is easy to use so probably the best way to get about. Loved brussels though. Would visit again ,5
Super location cool bar clean rooms simple but totally sufficient breakfast safe area ,9.2
Hostel has a great little bar with lots of great local beers at a reasonable price. They offer a free walking tour which is a great way to see the study and the staff were great. Found someone elses rights in the room. The beds were quite hard and the toilet was slightly blocked from whoever had used the room before. If you want to use a towel it will be an extra 3 euros so make sure you take your own.,7.1
Everything was OK. Good location basic room acceptable breakfast. No towels only if you pay for it.,8
It was nice and clean The extra bed you put,7
The location was really good and the atmosphere was nice really like the staff they were warm and welcmoing. ,7.5
Comfortable rooms and clean.  Breakfast was okay.  A little far from the train stations.,7.5
The room was clean cozy and convenient and the view from the window was nice. The staffs were helpful and friendly. The location is good only 30 minutes walking from some main tourist attractions such as Eglise Notre Dame Brussels or Grand Place. The breakfast included was nice as well. Comparing the amount of money I have spent with the service I received I highly recommend this hostel. The room should be equiped with hairdryer and towels. In addition even though I was informed about the luggages locker and has prepared mine but none of my locks can fit with the luggages lock hole ,8.8
There has a big kitchen for the guests to use. No lift for the building that I live.,9.2
Central location. Good bar staff. Good breakfast. Room cleaning. Attention needs to be paid to room cleanliness.,7.5
Good breakfast nice staff well located Would recommend We havent recieved sheet for the blankets but two simple bed-sheets. A lot of noisy groups,7.9
 Window of the room was broken. Therefore it was cold,7.1
I liked the location and the staff was very friendly. Very noisy room. Room also was outdated.,7.1
*Great location (close to any destination in Brussels thanks to the tube stations and many bus/tram stops)*shops and bars nearby*spacious common area and luggage store*rooms with a nice view comfortable beds lockers (must have your own locks) spacious bathroom*well equipped clean kitchen*sufficient breakfast*nice atmosphere*helpful and kind staff *late check-in (although you can leave your luggage before and after check-in),9.2
Breakfest was nice. And nice cantine. Mold all over the shower tiles. And it smelled so bad.,4
Nice external courtyard on arrival with an on-site bar overlooking.  Room was very spacious for a three single bed room and had a separate seating area and shower room. The bar was reasonably priced.  Area was quite central and easy to walk into the main centre of Brussels. On arrival we were told the hostel arrival policies were changing and we had to check-in at the bar which was busy at the time. But not a big deal and we were able to order a drink and check-in at the same time. Also there was a ¬£3 charge for towels. Fine as this was mentioned in the policies but when the towels are only available during (short) reception opening hours it was hard to ever get the towels!,7.9
Everything was ok. The pictures look much better than reality. The night receptionist boy was sarcastic and not really helpful when we asked for help. The blanket sheets were not really blanket sheets just a regular one layer sheet which was not comfortable at all and also of course that is not good in a way of hygiene. Wifi was super bad almost did not work at all.,6
The staff the mood and the location are all great! The mattresses were very hard I wasnt able to sleep well. ,7.9
Nice people at the reception nice bar with interesting beer options. Close to train station I got an uber for 5 euro (i could have walked if I had lighter luggage) there are stairs to get to the rooms so you cant bring heavy luggage,8.3
I stayed there two days The electricity was out of service two times and they couldnt resolve the problem and  expect me be patient and nice to them.   They were not even willing to switch the room for us.   Finally four of us even stayed the room smaller then the one we have. ,4.6
Excellent location in a vibrant neighbourhood. We loved the rooftop pool and bar. Room was rather small for 6 adults but OK. Unfortunately we had very noisy neighbours in the room next to us and the walls werent soundproof enough.,7
Great location Brussels isnt well sign posted so if youre not regular travelers one may struggle to find the hotel. Other than that cant really complain.. You get what you pay for!,7.9
Staff was helpful and polite.  Design style of hotel was fun. The room was a little to small for three people.  The beds were not cozy they had a single flattened pillow and awful wool blankets draped over the top of the beds.  Im allergic to wool and felt like I was going to get a rash just from removing the quilt.  The wool quilt felt heavy and dirty.  How does a wool quilt get washed?,6.7
It is a cool hotel The front desk reception was very unfriendly at the check in. No any words of welcoming.I didnt have the same ID with me as the one I used for the online pre check in. This was a big issue I almost left the hotel so unbelievable unfriendly.I am the owner of hotel in The Netherlands and I would immediately fire my employe with this kind of attitude. Send him to a course to learn him hospitality!,6.7
Clean nice interior great location great bar and rooftop spots with an amazing view. The room was spacious and very comfortable (reading sofa/lounch area in the room). ,9
Noise not an issue good smoking area. Staff friendly.  Lighting too dim in corridor.,7
The breakfast was too thin I ask them for food that was empty and they say that they didnt have anymore. The worker at the reception was great.  But totally I will not come back. But if you go alone and want some cheap hotel this is the one. Breakfast cleaner the screaming outside the hotel that start 04.00 and too hot in the rooms,5.8
Great decor arty rooms with super bed. Staff couldnt be more helpful.  ,10
The bed was comfortable The pool was not heated,4
Constuction materials Loud music at night,8.8
the location of the hotel is fantastic and the hotel was very clean. We have chosen the hotel because of the location  and swimming pool.There was no air-conditioning very small ventilator no rules to use the swimming pool during the corona.The swimming pool was always crowded with the same people.we have tried to enter in the swimming pool on a Saturday at 17h45 but then it was closed because there was a party.information about the party was not given in the reception. ,7
location of hotel proximity to brussels city centre economical parking charges the room was too small too congested for my family group of 6. The room was enough to accommodate 3 double beds but there was hardly any space to move around for 6 people in one room. To make it worse only 1 bathroom (toilet and shower all behind one door) meant longer preparation time to get ready. One of the most disappointing room (comfort-wise) I have stayed in.,5.5
Lobby area. Hard to park.  Rooms quite dark.,6.3
Staff was nice No air conditioning and in a sketchy part of town.  Parking was 15 euros a day paid to hotel on top of room fee.  Restaurant and down statues bar were never open to use and pool was loaded with children so we couldnt use that either. ,6.3
Cool rooms and decor. Good prices and pool bar plus wellness option available. Spacious room. Bathroom could have been much cleaner. There was hair in the shower sink and the shower curtain had toothpaste stains. Wellness is charged separately at $44 per person.,8
We liked very much the hotel. The room was spacious clean. The location very good also very near Avenue Louis. I recommend! ,8
Clean and comfort room Location was ok for me but you must have on mind that the hotel  is far from the centerIt is close to Louisa street and metro station I was forced to ask  twice to remove reservation on my credit card because I paid in cashAlso they forgot to book a taxiNo  slippers in the roomThe price was  too high for this hotel ,7.1
Modern design. Game room. Breakfast especially range of fresh juice No air con no double glazing. We went over large bins in streetcleannidern,7.1
unfortunate that the rooms were very minimalist - a few more amenities and balcony would have been great noise level - the rooftop pool was unfortunately privatised for a private event on one of the nights.,7
The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly No have air conditioner for summer,10
Staff were all lovely aand rooftop bar was great. Also really useful having a luggage room to store your bags before you check in and after you check out! Room was a little smaller than expected but it was still really nice!,10
We liked the sleeping arrangements  very unique design.  The hallways were too dim for my taste but everything else was good.  Very clean  staff was accommodating.  Enjoyed the tiny pool and the rooftop bar. dim hallways.  game room was closed due to renovation.,8
I love the ambiance!! Amenities are fabulous! A great place for everyone! It has an overlooking view of the city from the rooftop! My niece loved the swimming pool :-) There was no air-conditioned! I was so disappointed because we visited Belgium in Summer and we were quite sweating in the room although at night it was A BIT chill (there was a small fan tho) but still it was so hot inside the room. When we opened the window for the air to get in there were some noises from the cars and garbage bins and other source of noise. I just hope the property informed the customers about this. I understand its cold during winter but I also hope they understand its hot during Summer. But overall it was fantastic!,10
nothing- the price we paid for for a  hotel did not meet a three star hotel expectation at all. I would never stay here again. ( please stay away). The photos shown vs reality of the hotel doesnt match too. -no air-conditioning for the hot weather -no fridge in the room (which is really basic) -uncleanliness of the rooms there was still hair in washed bedsheets and cornflakes on the floor when we checked in. -no ventilation fan in the bathroom which made the room so stuffy and smelly -customer service wasnt really helpful they were careless,2.9
Great funcky place in Brussels. great for kids and couples. ,8.8
The decor of the hotel No air con in hotel or rooms no room to move in the rooms I struggled to put my bag some where in the room only one really small fan in a 4 person bedroom no fridge in room,4.6
Great location staff facilities. The swimming pool and rooftop bar are excellent. The lifts are very small and always crowded.,9
SParking not availble buffet without eggs and the wi for everyday. Swiming pool.,4
Nice hotel concept charming concrete which generates a quite unique visual identity. Many details (bunk beds for kids with sliding doors etc). The rooftop pool looked quite inviting and also the bar on top is very nice with some view over the city. The staff is friendly and helpful when approached. Family room for five was generally set up in a nice way due to the bunk bed concept. However for 5 people and luggage the room was small. Certainly not the place to spend more time than for sleeping and bathroom. The place can have somewhat of a youth hostel feeling it needs some initiative from the guests to get stuff done.,7.1
Nice bed Room in first floor noisy due to tram outside. Hotel looks very cool but actually is little more than a budget hotel with a few design features,6.3
The pool are and rooftop Need aircon in rooms,7.5
The decor was very different which I liked ,7.5
Location Clean hotel Good service  The bed ,5
The Staff are very helpful most specifically Ms.Elodie.will definitely stay on the next visit. ,10
The unique Brutal Architecture atmosphere is all over the hotel. In the smallest details the concrete is coming to you The bed was excellent. (better than i have at home) ,9.2
Good location nice Roofdeck bar which operates independently from Hotel. The pool is a good add on Restaurant in the hotel very convenient.  Designed rooms but overall simple. No air condition .. when outside temperatures above 30 degrees,7.9
I was only here for one night but I enjoyed this hotel.  It is close to several casual restaurants with good food.  My room was small but comfortable.  The rooftop bar and sitting area was very nice and gave you a nice view over the city. The room wasnt very soundproof.,9.6
The decor is cool.  The restaurant looks nice albeit pricey and the rooftop bar area is great. The lift is tiny struggled to fit two people with luggage.  No air-conditioning in the rooms made the stay really uncomfortable during the heat wave.  The small desk fan really didnt help.  The hallways have a slight hostel feel. Its about 10-15 minutes to the city centre so not super convenient had to take Uber or public transport.,5
It was modern industrial and just had a really cool vibe. My daughter loved sleeping in the top bunk and having little slider doors to close herself away. Breakfast option was expensive so we chose not to eat there but other than that we were satisfied.,8.3
I liked the friendliness of staff and decor of commonly used rooms Breakfast was gone in no time the pool was closed on Friday once we got to swim in it it was morning and bar was closed the rooms and pictures didnt exactly match,6
Cool furnishings and bar Couldnt use the roof terrace or pool as they were booked both nights for a private party. Not cool,7
Comparing to other hotels the Jam was an average one. The room was OK quite large and I particularly liked a large ellegant bathroom. Breakfast was OK too. In January the tea set in the room was a great help. For me the design was too much. The photos in the hotel gallery look much better than reality. I do not mind an industrial style or admitted concrete at all but some grafiti on walls were truly scary. The ride by lift was an absolutely claustrofobic experience.,6.7
 We choose this hotel because it was rated really good. We assumed it will be really clean during corona but it wasnt (look at the pictures). Also there is NO AIR CONDITION!!!! We had one little fan for the whole room. The room was also super small. The Pool was very crowded and nobody was wearing a mask at the pool side. The Rooftop Bar was also super full and there is no AC either. We are really sorry that we have to complain about that but it was really just a disappointment..,3
Breakfast was amazing!!  Rooftop bar was also amazing!  Cool vibe!! Front desk very helpful!! Wish it were closer to City Centre.,9.6
Funky quirky hotel. Kids loved the unusual bunk beds! Games room was also a hit. Beds comfortable hotel itself quiet. There is outside noise but youre in a city!  ,10
It was very clean and had a lovely terrace and pool area. There were renovations going on so there wasnt a restaurant for a proper breakfast and the games room wasnt open.,8.8
Good price underground style good breakfast arranging staff ,8.8
Good room size  for 4 member family. Well located with parking. Walking distance to city center. Our room was facing the street and it was a bit noisy until late in the night (trams passing by).,8.8
Good for families that need a short term place to stay Rooms are small. To put five people in one room is a bit much with the size of the room being what it is. Additionally the room is positioned on the street side and you can hear the street car and every other noise throughout the day and evening. Definitely not sound proof from the heavy traffic and a very uncomfortable to get a decent nights sleep.,8.3
its got a really nice atmosphere the little details make it really cool and the roof top bar is excellent.  kids loved all the art work in the corridors air conditioning not available in the room was the only thing,7.5
 they are advertising pool temperature at 28 degrees yet it was definitely not heated on both our stays there,7.9
Room 601 should not be rented to anyone is below the 7 floor bar and there is noise till 1230 am not a place to sleep Room 601 should not be rented to anyone is below the 7 floor bar and there is noise till 1230 am not a place to sleep,5.4
Breakfast was fine. The gameroom in the basement is really nice. The top floor cafe is awesome. Rooms are perfect. Personnel in the groundfloor cafe was really unfriendly and was did a poor job in hospitalizing a large group that clearly just arrived and didnt know the place yet. One minor detail about the rooms: We had only 2 towels in our 4 person room.,7.5
Everything was enough i enjoyed my stay. My other colleagues talked about your delicious break first - a bit annoyed to not have access to it but anyway next time :D,8.8
The location was nice The pool was overcrowded and really dirty. I expected them to clean it overnight for the day after but when I went to the pool the day after in the morning it was still the same disgusting. In this period of Covid I would expect a little effort.,2
We especially liked the interoir design of the hotel and the bar and pool area. The view from the rooftop is spectacular. The hotel is in one of the nicest areas of brussels with loads of nice Restaurants and Bars nearby! Unfortunately the restaurant was renovated during our stay and the replacement breakfast was a little expensive (5‚$) for what was offered (pastries bananas apples yoghurt and coffee). However we really enjoyed our stay not really a downside.,9.2
Nothings. A hotel without AA in summer no has refrigerator in rooms offer one bottle of water for five persons. The elevator is insufficient. And finally the location is really  far away the tourist zone. ,3.3
New modern and slightly unique decoration in the building. Really nice. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and presentable. Location is not bad 10 mins walk from a busier high street and not far from city center.   Paying for on-street parking outside was a bit of a faff as the hotel car park was full. The pillows were not very pleasant (one is a bag of cotton wool the other a very thick memory foam). Theyre the only negatives here everything else was great. ,9.2
Clean room with good facilities . Centrally located and had free parking spaces nearby Old industrial look with concrete walls cushions and throw had some sort of fibres which can exacerbate allergic reaction if some one is prone to allergies.  room was very small for a family of 5,7.1
The style was authentic the staff were nice There was a lot of noise on the street and the windows werent noise proof.,7
Swimming pool and roof top bar Bathroom did not smell nice the first day,9.2
Breakfast was good at least most of it. because the fresh juice didnt taste fresh. Swimming pool is not a swimming pool. Hotel was promising a bike but at arrival they said bikes are stolen! And there was no alternative or refund given.,5.8
Good location Toilet in our 2 person room did not have a door at all. This was rather inconvenient with a girlfriend. The stairs were next to the room and it was impossible to sleep in the morning when people were going up and down and speaking loudly at the reception.,6.3
Warm welcome and great choice for breakfast with fresh fruit salad and boiled eggs several types of bread. Comfortable beds and nice warm shower. We were 8 and would have liked a place to play cards or drink a tea before going to bed. During summer there is a nice place outside but during winter this does not fit.,8.3
The property owners were super friendly and the breakfast was good. The location is good and easy free parking. Close to the beach the village center Supermarket and tram stop. Very convenient. The room and linen are very clean. Unfortunately the bed mattress was not very comfortable especially for someone who has a bad back and walls are pretty thin that we can hear everyone and all noises. If youre a heavy sleeper its not problematic.,7
Great location wonderful breakfast. Great hosts Large gap about my sons room door. Asked owner to help but says there was nothing he could do. Sandy floor n out room plus broken tiles in the shower.,6
Excellent location friendly staff clean property. There were  issues of privacy.  The on- suite toilette has been separated by  just a curtain rather than by a  proper door from our bedroom making it uncomfortable to use the bathroom (the other person had to leave the room to save both partners from the embarrassment). Furthermore the window of the room  overlooked a public area just arms-length from where other guests were socialising or passing by. This was also uncomfortable as  the window had to be kept open due to high temperature in the room so we felt quite exposed to the traffic by other guests. Considering these conditions and that breakfast was not included in the price I dont think it was a good value for money.,6.3
Very nice owners.Great breakfast.Convenient location. Toilet not separated from room.Same key for entrance and room (all the guests can can access the room!).Little privacy.,6
Very good location with the supermarket cafes banks round the corner and close to the sea and the coastal tram stop. Very nice owners pleasant room pretty patio. Kettle microwave and cutlery put at the guests disposal. Stayed on the ground floor and could hear a bit the noise from the other rooms especially from the room above.,8
Room Breakfast and location all exceeded our expectations! ,10
Old couple run the place they are friendly. Smell of smoke inside (in all rooms incl. entrance hallways and restaurant). Dusty surfaces everywhere unclean floors. Shabby and dirty bedlinen and furniture in rooms. All of this is not in line with the price for the stay.,4
The outside of the building is beautiful. Sadly the inside is very simple and not at all in the style of the exterior.,7.5
The bathroom is large and very clean beautifully decorated  ( better than the room itself)The breakfast is exceptional  with home made  products and fresh croissants . The wines could be tasted from the own cellar in a cosy ambience. All was great but I expected a nicely furnished room room . The TV set is very small.,8.3
Nice room and enough for one person the bed was comfy enough taking into account that i am 1m90. The decor is not very modern but still clean and the bathroom has a nice size. The bathtub is good enough also. Overall for the short stay i had there it was really nice The floors a bit thin in the sense that if there are people in the room above you you can hear them a bit. The TV is really an old model but again if you go there it is not to watch the tv :),8
Great location most beautiful scenery the gardens are lovely. La maitresse-de-hotel friendly and accommodating - we found really great options to dine out at her recommendation. It would have been nice to have vegetarian options at breakfast. Dining in temporarily not possible. The internet connection was somewhat unstable (one of the rooms completely outside range).,7
 Mosquitonets in window broken No shower Service at breackfast not that friendly,4
Restaurant Les Caves du Chateau was very good.  Dinner was delicious and breakfast was a great way to start a busy day.  The owners/managers were very friendly and helpful.  Bathroom was large with good heating.  Bedroom decorations could use a refresh but the chateau has lots of character and is located in a small picturesque village in the centre of the beautiful Ourthe River valley. Rooms were clean but in need of a refresh.,7
The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was amazing!! The grounds were very nice and the location met our specifications perfectly!! There was no WIFI although site said there was.  We keep in contact with family friends and work via WIFI (Email WhatsApp) and we were not able to do that nor do research on places we wanted to visit/hike.,8.8
We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful castle! The staff was really friendly and the dinner was excellent! ,8.3
Not soo much! Breakfast was really poor.,5
Nice setting and a friendly staff. Perfect for our stay! ,8
One of the best things about Le Chateau de Rendeux is that it has no wifi. For the duration of the visit you will be compelled to enjoy whose-ever company you may be in and you will be forced to enjoy unbearably good hospitality. We were the only guests during our stay and enjoyed one of the finest meals of our lives attentively prepared and paired with a marvelous wine which was recommended by our host. Breakfast was also superb. All was interspersed with engaging conversation in broken French and English. That I didnt write down the names of our hosts so that I could thank them directly here again. I didnt like that I wont be there in the later spring or summer to see what the grounds will look like when they are in bloom.,10
The restaurant provided really nice food and excellent service. ,8
This was an overnight stop on our journey home.  It was set back from the road into town and the garden ran down to the river. It was quiet with plenty of parking and Chinese restaurant on site. Room was really nice overlooked the river and was well equipped and clean. Good breakfast and staff we met were really helpful.  Only problem was that the bed had a considerable dip in the middle.,10
Room was clean and heating was efficient. Bed was comfortable. Shower was quite good with choice of rain or ordinary. Sheets too small for bed so runkled up during the night. The restaurant was a Chinese restaurant and as neither of us like that type of food we didnt eat there.  Room and bedding smelled faintly of cigarette smoke.,7
A good beautifully located hotel that gave us a warm welcome and a comfortable stay as well as a good breakfast. The location next to the River Meuse is very pleasant and there is a good restaurant attached to the hotel (which is an annexe). You get a lot for your money and access is acceptable (if not ideal) for disabled people. One of the rooms we rented had had smokers staying in it. We had needed this room for the disabled access required by my mother. The owners had clearly made efforts to remove the smell but this had not been totally successful by the time we arrived.  It was also difficult to wheel my mother around in her wheelchair.,9.2
everything was perfect and the reception service was very welcoming and helpful. thank you again for the early check-in. everything was perfect,10
Chinese restaurant had excellent food with a good menu selection. Staff spoke Chinese French and English were friendly helpful and accommodating. Bed frame was old carpet was dirty radiator held up with pieces of wood bathroom stank of bleach but also managed to feel dirty at the same time. Window was broken (not the glass - it wouldnt open properly).  Overall I was happy with my stay because the staff were so lovely and helpful - plus the food was delicious!,6.7
 It should sound Bed and Breakfast but not Hotel,4.6
Restaurant on site a real bonus wide choice food tasty. Heating works to keep room warm on a cold winter night.  Showers good. Difficult to find in the dark sign not lit until restaurant opened. One room had good selection of TV channels the other room did not.,7.5
Central convenient location. Edible breakfast. On-site free parking was pretty convenient. The jacuzzi in our room was an unexpected but pleasant bonus. The hotel interior is a confusing maze. Glass bathroom door with clear view into the shower from the bed - beware if youre into any sort of privacy whatsoever.,7
The position was great the hotel was overall clean and friendly staff. The room interior was fairly poor (since we are talking about a 4 star hotel). The room itself was very dark with a very tiny window (basically no natural light coming in). Furnitures will definitively need a refurbishment.,6.7
the food (dinner and breakfast) was excellent. ,9
 No curtain in the bathtub - Taking shower results in splashing water all over.,8.8
Comfortable bed spacious room great curtains. The shower screen could be better fitted so that the floor wouldnt flood every time one takes a shower.,8.8
The entree is beautiful and you can park your call easily on one of the various parking slots close to the hotel. You can walk in 5 min to the city center which is nice. Our second room was lovely and exactly what we expected. We booked a room with sauna and whirlpool which was written in our confirmation. Unfortunately the hotel confirmed a room only with sauna but we were able to change the room after talking to the receptionist. What we didnt like was the service level at the reception- we had to wait till he finished 2 calls for more that 25 min (even if we were waiting already in front of the receptionist- he picked up the second call as well). In addition we would have appreciated to get recommendations for the area eg restaurants sightseeing etc. ,8
The property is indeed a historical building with very interesting inner architecture. The room was spacious There was no fan or window in the bathroom hence the bathroom was very smelly after use.  Although  it was very quiet on our floor I could easily hear the people upstairs. We got one of the rooms without sauna and jacuzzi and even in the middle of the night at 1 am I heard the noise of people upstairs in their jacuzzi. The room was also very dry generally I would improve the air conditions system. ,6.3
Its a unique historic hotel with spacious rooms and massive character ,8
Great locationgood restaurantclose to barsrestaurantsriver. No lift to actual floors so you have to carry cases up and down a narrow winding staircase,8.8
we arrived late after 9pm & went into restaurant at 9.30pm. Initially the maitred told us there was no availability but when they realised we were late arrivals their attitude changed & we got a great steak! As others have said it has an odd layout wiyj lots of stairs & bends. Decor universally brown,8
Building is full of character - beautiful and quirky. Excellent location for the town centre. Nothing.,10
Friendly service location close to city center. The room was very large with a nice bathroom. Very noisy. The room was next to the restaurant and under the roof top bar. So a lot of noise until approx. 11 PM. At around 5 AM the cleaning of the restaurant floor etc. started so not much quiet time. The pillows werent great. Dining at the grill restaurant did not meet expectations. It sounded great but was just about mediocre. No safe in the room.,6.7
Good breakfast and perfect location to explore the city. Nice design. There were some reconstruction works so it got really loud in the morning. Didnt get warned before.,7.9
 Initially we were placed in a room with broken air conditioning the unit dripped directly onto the bed. It was obvious they were aware as there was an extra fan in the room.  We we called the front desk they did move us but initially threatened that if we moved that night we would just have to move rooms the next day. In the end we were able to keep our new room but it could have been handled better by the staff,4
Good breakfast. Location good but not able to walk to town due to distance and no pathway. A bit run down.,4.6
Room bright view on the garden badroom  ,8
The bathroomThe crowdThe storage room for our bikeThe dinner The rooms were a bit small,7
 Bed room 29 needs a little tlc. Basin does not run away leaving dirty water. Bed side lights not on wall properly non of the doors shut properly,5.4
Great location. Rooms very neat. General old feel to it with maintenance needed in main building ,8
Friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast and dinner beautiful garden and seating area next to the Ourthe river  ,9
Breakfast and the garden! The staff were also great! The room was so so.,8.3
Located in woodland close to La Roche en Ardenne.Good restaurant . Rustic decor in keeping with location. Excellent car parking. Rooms good do with some TLC,6.7
New renovated rooms Small room. Poor value for money. Difficult to comunicate with the employees,6.7
We loved the view the gardens and location. There are also beautiful trails/promenades starting at the hotel site.Staff is also very friendly great service. Moreover the restaurant was great! We had an amazing dinner seasonal and very well prepared. Absolutely loved it. The rooms could use some freshening up decor-wise but they were very spacious and clean.The bathroom was minimal with a tub and shower curtain. I prefer a walk-in shower. ,9
Bathroom was obviously renovated and surprised me. Very clean and large bathtub. Had a room on the streetside as the windows are single ones the noise of the traffic was very loud and kept me awake. ,6.3
Superbe garden can stay here and just enjoy the surroundings.Walking distance (1km) to town.Dogs are allowed and welcomed by the staff unfortunately not by all the guests (one of the guest was pretty rude at breakfast about a dog being present).Breakfast is very nice. Gluten free options and rice milk provided. Nice croissants and fruit salad.  The venue is next to a busy road so you hear traffic up on tue terrace.Breakfast is quite early from 8 to 10.No table available for the terrace. We used the little table from inside with the lamp and booklets. ,7.9
The restaurant in the hotel for dinner was fantastic! The staff were also very friendly. Great proximity to hiking and also just a 20 minute walk to town. The rooms seemed quite old and the walls were quite thin so you could hear guests in other rooms. For the price I would expect a slightly higher quality. Also for the price I would expect the use of the sauna to be included.,7
Very friendly staff good and nice breakfast with great variation. Hotel is located at an extreme busy street a lot of noise at night. General atmosphere in hotel is old and authentic beds are really old and worn out all 5 in our group had pain in their backs next day.,5
Very nice place garden nice walk to the center La Roche good breakfast in every day the bedding was changed Good breakfast but without vegetables old-fashioned,7
Nice room in separate building from main hotel but very close and safe parking for motorcycle out of view from the road Very slow restaurant but the dinner was excellent,9.2
The location is very nice and the staff is very friendly and competent. The structure is nice not very old but it feels very much in line with the place. The exterior is definitely a plus the garden is beautifully maintained. The breakfast has some home made cake and stuff as well as apples and oranges from the garden. The room was not super-clean. We found some leftovers in the fridge from previous guests and there were some butterflies killed on the wall. The small terrace was basically unusable. There is no shower only a bath tub where showering is an adventure. It was not clear from the beginning that we had to pay a surcharge of 10% (14$) for our dog and we discovered at the moment of the check out. All in all it was a bit too expensive.,6.7
Combined hotel and restaurant with nice outside seating area. Decent size room equipped with mini bar. Room was a bit hot but there was ventilator provided. Very convenient private parking. Great selection for breakfast: fresh and good quality food. Only bath with shower-head no real shower. ,7.1
Very nice reception friendly ands welcoming. all requests and questions answered. Very nice surroundings peaceful and lots of nature. Took us more than 40 minutes to walk there - when we thought it was in town.,8
The breakfast and the dinner are very good. There is a proper dinner table on the room to have your meals and you get serve the dinner at the table with plates and cutlery.  That is a plus cause with the covid rules most of the times you end up eating in your room on the bed in lunch boxes weigh is terrible. ,9
The breakfast was pretty good. And the place was quite and near to la roche The room was pretty old and it smelled like the 60s not my favourite smell,6.3
Perfect location in Grote Markt which is very center of historical Antwerp in old typical building. Walking distance to any possible sight.Staff was very helpful) Antwerpen is amazing place highly recommended Matrasse in the bedroom ..,9
Location is perfect apartment is very clean spacious and comfortable. ,10
Excellent location in the middle of the city. Very friendly host. Missing smoke detectors open front gate to the street dirty couch old furniture and apartment in need of refurbishing and touch ups. Staircase very bad state. Very loud from neighbours no noise isolation.,3
 Incredible location. Very nice view. Spacious. Clean. Comfortable. On a walking street with free parking nearby. Great value for money. Easy access.,10
Location The stairway up is small and dirty. And the apartment smelled of smoke,6
Perfect location on the central square! The apartment is newly renovated and is fully equipped.  Everything was well organized  we didnt have to wait for the check-in or check-out. 1. The building doesnt have an elevator. A staircase is narrow and extremely steep. The apartment that we were staying at is located on the 2 floor. It might be ok for young people but for older guests its quite challenging. 2. There was a construction site right in front of the building so it was quite loud.,7
The apartment is nice spacious and clean. Easy check-in and check-out with the box. The location is right in the center. Steps to the apartment were narrow you have to be careful to not fall. Its a bit too bright even when you put down the blind the light can pass through.,8
Excellent location. Professional and nice staff. Very good breakfast. Very good quality of a reasonable price in Brussels. Everything was good as expected.,10
Nic quiet rooms reasonable price versus quality. Breakfast OK. Rooms do not have much light in the evening and those towards the street could be noisier.,7.5
The hotel had every thing you need lovely shower and bath and very good location.  Thanks you for fantastic stay ,9.6
Great location and the staff was amazing. The lighting in the bathroom is poor.,8.3
Comfortable and in city centre They gave me the last room next to the exit stairs not happy at all after so much money i get this. Absolutely devastated.,1
Very clean room large room  Although only a short walk from metro grand place etc i didnt feel like it was in a safe area we were two females alone and felt unsafe early evening etc   there is a coffee machine but you only get two pods per day there is a kettle but no tea bagsmilk etc    also the restaurant was closed on a Thurs for a public holiday but we were not advised of this and had planned to eat there due to not wanting to go out in the evening  I have stayed in other hotels who have notified us of any closures if it is going to effect our stay.  We were not expecting a public holiday on a Thurs . The breakfast wasnt the greatest  we were not asked if we wanted tea or coffee the first day and chose to have breakfast out after that,5.4
The room was really spacious. Bathroom was perfect. Additional towels slippers and blankets were provided. The heating was good. It is an old hotel so expect stains on the carpet and old TVs where you can not stick your USB stick.,7.9
The location was excellent the room was big and comfortable. The staff was very polite and pleasing. I had the confusion with check out date but I was provided with one more day in the hotel. Also the breakfasts were great. Bad shower bath. The water in the shower wasnt hot only warm. And we had to wait about 3-5 minutes after enabling the shower until water warms up to this not hot temperature. That was very annoying.,7.9
excellent location - couldnt have been more convenient.  Bathroom was really nice.  Staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant. ,9.2
Very modern rooms walking distance to the main sites and great value for money! I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The bed was very big and extremely comfortable! I have no complaints.,9
Good location clean room friendly staff Towels could have been bigger/better quality air-con didnt really heat the room up,7.5
location coffee machine in the room tv channels ,9.2
 there was a lot of dirt in the room. the doors from the bathroom were not cleaned for weeks. it was loud from ventilation.,3
Unbeatable location 10 minute walk to the Grand Place in downtown Brussels. Coffee machine included un room. Very spacious room enough to have 2 to 3 suitcases opened. Near supermarkets and  grocery stores selling good food if you dont want to pay for the extra breakfast In the hotel.  Bathroom with an overall strange smell indescriptible but present. Of course a few minutes after closing the door you dont smell it anymore because youre used to it but its there. ,8.8
Lovely consierge 24 hour reception. Spotlessly clean modern. Complimentary toiletries. We had a fantastic stay thank you very much!  Liked absolutely everything.,7.5
Auto in garage kunnen parkeren Kamer was klein,7.1
We love this hotel. We have stayed here twice now and it has been one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The staff are great and very helpful on arrival. The room was ready for us at 11am instead of 3pm which was very convenient. The room was great with high ceilings making the area feel a lot larger which was nice. The room has all the features you could ask for two TVs a shower/bath free grooming set etc. Loved this hotel. ,10
The bed was comfy Everything looked very outdated breakfast could definitely be improved. The coffee offered during the breakfast was one of the worst possible.,4.6
Central location short walk to the Grand Place and other tourist areas Rooms were clean comfortable and quiet ,8.8
 I have never experienced paying deposit in any hotel. They asked to guaratuee with 20euros beyond you pay the whole amount right after arrival. For not so cheap hotel in the centre it is guite embarrasing. Room is big but with old wooden furniture. Bathroom is fine but average not so clean.,5.8
I had a great breakfast. Hotel very well localised near the center and the room was clean. Nothing to add.,8.8
Location big bed very clean Loud banging on Monday morning at 8am,8.8
Good location and a great value for the price paid. ,7.5
It was easy to get to when coming from the main eurostar station.The room was spacious.Fresh bread at breakfast was delicious. Our room was nice but felt like it was an after though during construction. We were located past the fire exit stays and near the staff lift. This meant most mornings we had to squeeze past the maids trolley. We had to move the trolley on check out to make room for our luggage.We found tiny worms/ maggots in our bathroom near a hole at the base of the shower. Wasnt pleasant.The breakfast was good but the selection of hot food was limited but creamy mushrooms seemed to be a thing.I wouldnt say it was 4 stars ,7.5
Not so far from train and metro station. The room was dirty and uncomfortable.,4.6
Easy to find Very difficult to navigate. The gym was a joke the wifi wouldnt work very anonymous,5.4
Excellent staff Good location Very comfortable bed and pillowsGood size of the roomGood sounds isolation Furniture and carpet worn outBathroom needs a thorough scrubbing ,8.8
Friendly helpful staff a very nice restaurant with delicious food and a bar with every type of beer imaginable. The room could  have had a little more storage space i.e. chest of drawers and some minor repair work needed in bathroom (toilet seat kept coming loose).,7
 Room was to cold. We set the air conditioner on 28 C but it didnt help. Cold air kept blowing through the air grid. Turning it complete of didnt help either. There werent any radiators in the room. It felt like a fridge. Informing and complaining the hotel staff didnt help. Room temperature was well below 18 C.,5
Good location very good service and helpful staff. ,9
Room was okay I asked for a bottle opener but they didnt have it,6.7
Very comfortable room rather spacious all clean and nice. We were allowed an early check-in. Within walking distance of central station and all attractions - which was very convenient. We had a room overlooking some kind of space between buildings some other windows facing our window within very short distance so we kept the curtains closed almost the whole time. Also - not much daylight coming in. Only 2 Nespresso capsules available per day for free. ,9.2
The bed was very comfortable and overall very nice room. Nespresso machine in room didn t work.,9.6
The room was like a prison cell with a small window looking at the front wall in 2 meters and still they call it deluxe room and charge for 180 euros a night. The breakfast was very basic most hostels have similar or better cold coffee and tea and still u have to ask for it. Dont waste your money by staying at this hotel Room breakfast,4.2
Staff welcoming and helpful the facility himself and the location ,9
Great location.  Staff very nice & helpful.  Only stayed one night but was pleasant. Toilet had no sink..  There was a separate bathroom though with a sink & shower. You had to leave the toilet in the hall area to go back through the room & into the bathroom to wash your hands. Just found that strange.  See the point to have separate toilet but put a sink in there while you are at it..,6.7
the location is near to grand palace and surounded by shopping centre my windows view from my room,7.5
i like how the hotel is located in between central and nord station so that its like 10 min walking distance from either the station. The room feels spacious too. overall not too bad. i would recommend this to my friends nothing specific,8.3
 Bed bugs were found in the room (live ones). The staff took time to admit that the hotel had been treated weeks before despite the strong smell of chemical products.3 months after I am still waiting for the reimbursement of the dry cleaning of my clothes despite that I paid the hotel bill.,2
Nice location very close to the cozy small shopping streets of old town. Super fast wifi. Check out service was great. The room was quite big. The covers and pillows were not great. The cover very stiff. The bathroom sink area seemed quite disgusting due to tear and wear on the marble. Looked incredibly dirty. Room was somewhat basic while trying to give the appearance of quality.,6.3
Comfortablecleangood breakfast. Handy location 10 mins from the Centre. Everything was great apart from the strange odour coming from the bathroom. This was the sam in both rooms Seemed to be a drainage issue.,7.5
Cosy modern room and bathroom. Good breakfast.  Arrived at 22.30 hrs. Bar was closed.,8.3
Arriving at this hotel via public transport was very easy.  The hotel is easy to find and during check-in we thought the front desk was great.  The elevator system is a bit wonky but the room was large quiet and comfortable.  We only had 1 night stay.  We did have breakfast and found it to have a lot of choices.  It was very international as one would expect in Brussels.  Getting to the center of the city - Grand Place was a breeze.  It was less than 10 min walk if I remember correct.  I would recommend this hotel easily. ,9
The hotel was located near the tram station and was walking distance to the grand place. Very convenient. Room was big and comfortable. Noise level at night. Room was overlooking the street.,9.2
Very clean and very close to the city centre. Very good breakfast ,9.2
The bedrooms comfort and design. Breakfast selection was very good but service of milk hot water and coffee was chaotic. I suggested these should be available self serve. On two days food that that should have been hot was cold. On the third day - after complaints - everything was hot.,9.2
Beds were very very comfy..location excellent! Breakfast could have more variety. The lobby area outside the rooms was dark and not well designed,8.3
Location The rooms are dark and not clean,5
Its near the center the staff was helpful very help ful break fast was good No bag guy  And I have to pick the bags and walk a lot in the building of the hotel  No bathrob Its not 4 star hotel its 3 stars  They pick the food of the break fast without asking,5
Great facilities and location staff was nice too. The beds are very light. When you put two people together its very easy to fall in the middle since the beds separate really easily.,8.8
LocationCoffee machine in the roomMatras The coffee at the restaurant,9.6
It was comfortable room. The bathroom was modern and nicely set out.Check in was efficient.A good breakfast provided but you have to pay $15 for ir.Excellent location  Nothing really - I could not quite work out how the coffee maker worked particularly as the instructions were unclear and the lighting in the room dim,8.8
A big room with everything you may need. Good location on a silent street. Street parking is right next to the entrance. Good breakfast. ,8.3
The location is great for visiting the center of Brussels as everything is at walking distance.The isolation of the room Its very good and you cannot notice the traffic from the road or the noise from the street. The breakfast was a bit disorganised they were removing it 15min before the closing time for breakfast. They did not replenish the bread hot water etc. during the scheduled breakfast time. ,7.1
Location The hotel is old rooms and equipment are needed for renovations.,4.6
 The hotel has disappointed us. Once we entered our room we noticed that the floor in the shower is full of water because it was dripping from a few spots around lights (!) on the ceiling. We asked for another room the hotel staff wasnt even surprised. We realised that it must be something common for them because in the new room the ceiling also had old traces of water. Everything in the rooms furniture towels looks old there was no fridge. The breakfast was also disappointing: the choice was very poor the quality of food is not perfect either. Probably a few years ago this hotel indeed deserved its 4 stars but not anymore. Only its location makes the hotel attractive but for the rest it requires significant changes.,6.7
Room is very comfortable and you can find so many free space in the room. parking is very expensive and every time you have to take coin for go out. Its very interesting.,7.9
 Bad shower.. To crowded at breakfast.. Bad smell in the lobby.. Poor equipped gym..,4.6
The bed was very comfy. Very disappointed that the in house nightclub was not operating. This was the main reason for us booking this hotel. It was advertised on the website. (FALSE ADVERTISING),6
Great bed and pillows. Friendly staff. Other people hair in the bathroom. i get that its not easy to get rid of them all so only one point taken for it. Expensive car parking. But a free one near by only 4 mins walking,8.8
Great Location! Great Receptionist! Great facilities and accomodation upon my arrival. Free parking lot outside the hotel (about 500 fts). Overall a hoptel with great value and I will definitely choose to stayt again! Not at all,10
The bed was perfect. There was so much noise! We specifically asked for a silent room and we received the one in front of the elevator which was making a lot of noise every time it arrived to the floor! We could listen the people in the corridor and the room just next to ours.. We didnt spend a good night at all.,5
The site was good and the receptionist was helpful. He provided a map and inform us about the places worth to visit. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. ,7.9
The front desk staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The food was fairly poor quality for breakfast and for dinner. For dinner I resorted to using food delivery services and I ended up skipping breakfast on my last day,8
Every thing was very nice. I will definately come again. Was very happy. No complains. The hot water in the bathroom. Was too hot . Maybe I did not regulate it properly.,9
I liked the location and the staff. Its a beautiful hotel and the staff made it. Rooms were lovely and spacious and beds very comfy. The food choice was poor. So poor that I ate only tomato soup for our whole stay. And the prices were extortionate. Although time from ordering to receiving food was very quick. The bathroom although clean hygienically didnt look it. The bath had stains and the sealant was mouldy.,8
Large clean rooms!Beds were pretty good. Friendly staff.  Could do with better pillows!Location is good as its right next to a bus stop and tram station but youre still about 15-20 mins away from the city centre. ,8.3
big rooms good breakfast! Old hotel! Like traveling back in time.,6
Nothing really .. hotel needs a makeover old furniture and bathrooms Everything needs a makeover: room bathroom matrasses.  Breakfast was not up to the standard you expect in such a place: eggs without taste coffee without taste (nice machines but quality of the beans questionable) only industrial bread rolls .. We wont be back,4
Everything was very good we have been a few times and its always really good. Staff are polite and very helpful. Their was nothing to dislike and we will be back for another visit.,10
Huge family rooms Old bathrooms mediocre water pressure awkward positioning of the shower head,8
Have to pay for parking which seems a bit harsh as its not exactly city centre!? ,8
easy parking in the Hotel Garage. friendly staff at the bar late dinner possible. Rooms nicely equiped and newly renovated. old lobby and old carpets and partially old furniture.,7.5
front office staff very nice clean comfortable efficient hotel suitable for short visits.,7.9
Spacious  quiet room.  Location just inside ring worked well for us to park at hotel and use transit to go into the city. Parking fee of $15 per night is excessive.,9.6
 Techical service person enyered room without request and my permissionCoffee machine broken - no coffee available for breakfast,3.8
Did not have time for the breakfast. But the hotel looks good. Someone used my room number to go to the breakfast in my name. When I have to pay at check-out I discovered this situation and I was surprised that the hotel does not use an identification way for people using the restaurant for the breakfast. It was not a pleasant moment when I have to say to the reception that I can not pay for something I did not use. The reception should take in account my concern for this situation as anyone can go in your name and try to get in your room asking for a key.,9.2
Close to ring Rooms are rather dated.. entrance and hallways have been updone.SubSaharian waterpressure in the shower. Very slow and inconsistent WIFI. Small parking garage no intercom pricy,5.4
The room was big clean and very comfortable. I loved the bed very very comfortable. The staff was helpful and kind.  Due to covid regulations There was no buffet offered at the premises for safety measures.,7.5
Good parking for my bikeAnd just off the ring road  ,9.6
Specious and comfortable room very friendly staff and lovely garden at the back. ,9
Clean rooms Quite warm bedrooms. No possibility to open windows,8.8
 The staff member at the reception was very rude. We were with a little baby of one month and even with rooms available they didnt check-in us by the moment we arrived. We had to changed him in the middle of reception. Very bad experience.  The breakfast also was below expectations.,5.8
Practical as not too far from the wilrijkse plein Nothing,9
Room was clean. Helpful people at the front desk. The room was a bit too warm for our liking. Had to bring a fan to help cool it off. Not sure breakfast was worth the 18$ per person.,7.5
Location was convenient although not in the center. Room was spacious In the room next door they were having a party. I complained to the reception but it did not help. Amenities in the bathroom were very poor and not replaced. A complimentary bottle of water was given only sporadically,6.7
The room was big and spacious. The bed was big as well. The breakfast was good and refilled when we asked. My room smelt of cigarette when we open to walk in.,8
Very comfortable and staff were very friendly. I have been charged ¬£13.19 and would like to know what for please.,8
Good location The front desk staff name Martin was shockingly rode and raciest at one point he mentioned to us you should know this is not your country simply we had questions on check out when we realised they charged us different rate then to our initial booking through Booking.com.Its shame for Ramada  to hair this kind of characters.,5
The location and comfortable bed. Most hotel mattresses are not good for my back this was firm and comfortable. The fact that the hotel has been surrounded by other buildings with literally no view of the surroundings but other buildings.,9
I was already staying in some other Mercure hotels so I had some expectations. The facilites were nice and the personnel was very kind and helpful In my room there was no way to open the window and at the reception I got an information that is like this in all hotel for the security reason. awful,8
Breakfast was filling and delicious The isolation. We had a terrible nights sleep because of noisy neighbors until 3am,5
The breakfast was outstanding the best I have ever had in a hotel.  I contacted the hotel before my stay to ask please for a good room as it was a special occasion for me and my partner.  They offered us an update of the room if available (unfortunately it was not possible - of course as on August hotels tend to be full) but they have the kindness of giving us a box of chocolates a special gift. Very thoughtful.   We needed an iron and a board and also a couple of hard bags and they supplied to us straight away we ask for info regarding transport and we were very well informed. When leaving the hotel they asked us if all went alright. Seem to be a bit short of staff in some occasions but anyway they responded well to all we needed.,7.9
Location.Quiet roon Could not get English TV.First room allocated was noisy so asked to move.Charged for a late checkout No draws in room.,4
It was near the Midi railway Station very near the Channel Terminal. I had a spacious room. The works outside the hotel make every journey from and to the hotel very annoying.  $21 per person for breakfast seems quite expensive.,7
needed a central Brussels hotel and this fits the bill-walking distance from Gare du Midi. Street outside being dug up and in the rain was very muddy. Roadworks outside made street muddy,8
It was okay. They had tea and coffee and a kettle in the room and the shower was good. The bar area looked nice and the curtains were good at blocking out the light. The location was near the train station but in a really grim area. There was a lot of construction work going on outside and you had to walk across a makeshift bridge/metal plank to get into the hotel. Whole area was run down and not pleasant to walk through.,5
Nothing to like I find this hotel really disappointing. The first room they gave ne has drainage problem after I told the reception they changed me another room but this rooms floor lamp is broken they promised they will call the technician to fix it but in the following 5 days the lamp still satys broken.. The bathros is old and dirty so is the rug also the construction outside is very dirty. Its not close to the station also the area looks not really goodÔºövery dirty and ghettoish,2.9
 The hotel was noisy at night. The breakfast was terrible not worth the price. I found some hair in the bathroom too. Overall it was okay but was expecting better as a 4* hotel.,5
Everything else is great. Breakfast is delicious staff are friendly and helpful  It is very difficult to work out how the room key turns the lights on. We spent ages trying to find a dark attachment on a dark wall to turn the lights on. Its not just us - another guest had to ask us how to do this too.,8.3
Location was good just 10 min by feet to centrum of Brussel. Room and the beds were big. It was silent. Everything ok. There was nothing what i didnt like.,7
The wellness centre was great..well maintained. The location was was convinient for getting around. The room alot bigger than i expected however some the furnishings looked tired..could do with replacing. The tired looking carpet and chair in the room. Attention to detail was lacking in the room.,7
Great breakfast choices! Carpet was old and stained.,7.1
Cannot fault the hotel for cleanliness and friendliness of staff who attended to anything we asked. The hotel facilities were great and the breakfast was really good value and lots of choice. However the trip was marred by the fact that I had my phone stolen outside the hotel! The hotel is not situated a particularly nice area although very convnenient for the Eurostar.,8
Good location close to Bruxelles Midi Station and the Metro. Fantastic extra services like: spa and jakkuzi. Latest check out time as well (12:00) what I experienced so far. Cleaning everyday with fresh towels ans sheets. The room was cold the thermostat did not do much for us.,8.8
The staff were very friendly offered us a free late checkout.Great location for Brussels Midi. Spacious rooms. a little outdated could do with a thorough clean and some paint touch ups,9.6
 We were not informed about the parking risks on the streets nearby . There are plenty of road works nearby and we could not park on the street But the receptionist said it was fine to park nearby rue de l Argonne So we did. Yet the car was towed away overnight because of the market taking place there the following morning. We had to pay 22360 euros to get the car back and waste half a day to go through the whole process. We are now expecting compensation from the hotel as we were not informed about that risk and the receptionist knew the area was going through tough times because of the road works. She did not warn us at all.,7
Shower Builders started drilling early the next day. Bed was hard.,7
the entrance hall the reception . the dinning room was very good nice view in the garden. room and bed very comfortable. toilet separated from bathroom no bath tub but a shower.sofa bed not very nice,7.9
Its a small hotel (70 rooms) comfortable friendly staff hotel location very convenient accessible (4minutes walking from the station). In the same streets restaurants and supermarkets. Walking distance 15 minutes to Grand-Place. Les travaux publiques devant lhotel,9
spacious room but not value for money the spa - terrible shower facilities with little drainage leaving us wading through the shower area! getting wet feet and clothes !Bar food service was appalling. One person covering reception and bar. Ran out of pizza which was basically supermarket poor quality and inedible. Not offered cutlery or crockery to share the one pizza that she had left. This is supposed to be 4 star !!!!!,5
The bed was very comfortable and the shower was a lovely size with good running hot water The construction outside the hotel. It was very muddy which damaged our footwear,9
Bed was good. Bathroom was spacious. WIFI was good. Lightings of the room cannot be turned off separately. The refrigerator was not cold enough.,8.3
A genuine 4 Star hotel Near to railway station and the staff were great The area is run down and in need of renovation.,8.3
Bathroom was big enough and the hotel was close to gare du midi station. Not clean,5
great staff nice clean hotel. shady characters drunk on the street outside hotel.,7.5
Facilities staff flexibility to bring children Located in a bit shady area if you go outside in the night,7.9
Nearby station for travel. Friendly staff. The location was hard to find due to al road closures. Garage good but very small for SUV. Hotel was good but the surroundings area not quite lot of shady people. And unfortunatley Welness closed.,7
The hotel and facilities were clean. The staff were very helpful. Although its beside the raid with train and train the noise did not affect us in the room. There wasnt much not to like. We find the price for breakfast a bit expensive,7.9
I get bad service and its totally different from what I see in the west the camer and breakfast parking totally I am  not expecting like this I now Mercury in the hege Netherlands he is too really nice hotel but your hotel ,1
Location perfect for train station but spoilt by so many building works that blocked easy access to hotel. Room comfortable. Smell from sewers kept drifting through into room - think from the works outside.,7
Overall all good only the payment is wrong I have stayed in many hotels and this was the first hotel when I checked in they asked for paymentand on this booking.com it says pay at hotel that means pay after stay not when check in its the same has paying up front first thats not an option ,10
Breakfast was delicious the rooms are big and comfortable and we booked it because of the whirpool :) and used it after a long day of walking!  The area around is not so nice but in 15 min walking you are in the city centre so very close!! But we would not like to walk there at night alone (two woman). Parking is with 25 euros also a bit expensive. But nevertheless i would really recommend the hotel. ,9.2
The room was very spacious. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel is located in an area I could easly name Little Maghreb. I dont want to make any further comments :),8.8
Amazing choice for breakfast! located close to the train station very helpful and friendly staff and clean and comfortable bedrooms. Nicely decorated hotel. Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel Only downside was lack of a restaurant,9.2
Nice breakfest. Near the metro The neighborhood isnt plesent. The room are small for a full family (we where 2 adult one kid and a baby) ,8.3
Large room well decorated  comfortable bed. Separate toilet to bathroom always a bonus. Close to station Torn sofa looked like it was from verge pickup. Not a good looking an otherwise nice room. Property  access from street was restricted and difficult late at night through road works barriers and mud and slush,8
Friendly helpful staffComfortable beds and bedrooms Quiet at night  Roadworks directly outside hotel made it difficult to access front entrance on foot ,8.3
Hotel was clean comfortable and staff was really friendly. Nothing in Hotel,8.3
 No sandwichs or something to nible n the bar White it was poste. Hotel parking quitte expansive No robe for the SPA,7.1
The location was ideal for us. The Front Office staff were not helpful when ask for a help on direction or other services not offer by the hotel.,5
The location The beds where very hard to sleep on,7
Very large clean rooms with a great breakfast selection!! The front desk staff were very helpful with enquiries.  Lots of construction out the front made it difficult to find and park.,8.3
Being just a 5 minute walk from Eurostar and a 15 minute walk from the Grand Place was just fantastic. The room was spacious and clean and the staff were very kind and accommodating. Even though the hotel is situated on a busy road the rooms were very quiet due to great sound proofing. During the night there was a very disruptive guest in another room but within 5 minutes of ringing reception silence returned to the hotel. Leaving our cases at reception on our last day while we continued to visit the Christmas markets to pick them up before catching our train just helped for a stress free weekend. Great customer service! ,7.9
Check in was easy and because it was 37 degrees they gave us extra cold water. Room was lovely and spacious very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was situated near the station but the area was very run down. I went with my daughter and as we walked around we felt vulnerable and at times unsafe. Just a few doors from the hotel is a sex shop and a sex show club.,8.8
Breakfast is super! Rooms are very very confortable and clean. The location is perfect for Gare du midi but..,8
Room and bathroom were huge the extra large bed was amazing the staff were all lovely really large selection of food at the buffet breakfast hotel so close to the Eurostar station. Even though our room was at the front of the hotel and by a very busy road the soundproofing was brilliant slept really well the whole of our stay The road Hotel Mercury is on always seemed to have men hanging around it in groups in the evening it definitely made my husband and myself feel uneasy when walking past them to get into the city or to the lovely restaurants by the station. ,8.3
Room was clean Made 2 complaints about noise from a neighbouring room. Hotel staff did nothing about this noise continued. Had a terrible nights sleep. Spoke to reception staff about this when checking out they were completely disinterested with our comments and reluctantly gave an apology. Manager was not around to speak to. No compensation was offered. Awful stay.,3
Close to Eurostar.  Good breakfast and shower. Awful service did not feel safe in this location.,5.4
The hotel itself was lovely clean and modern. The room was very spacious and had everything we needed. It was roughly a 5 minute walk from the train station so was very handy as we had lots of bags to carry! The atmosphere around the hotel made us feel quite unsafe the area was dirty and run down. However when the road works along the road of the hotel are complete this may improve. We walked into the centre on the first day but the people nearby made us feel uneasy so we got ubers for the rest of our trip.,8
Cheap. The staff werent helpful.  We have stayed in 3 hotels since in different areas in Belarus and all of the rest have registered us and made our stay easy. The lady at  reception gave no help just a website to visit. Its also in the middle of nowhere. ,4.6
The staff was very hospitable. The rooms were new and clean. The walls were very thin so sometimes I heard someone snoring. The mattress was very soft but maybe it would depend on your preferences.,7.9
The staff were really nice and helpful. The rooms were nice too. The on-site restaurant is good if not slightly expensive for Minsk but they were super accommodating. We dont speak Russian and everyone made a huge effort to communicate with and help us which was very much appreciated! If you have a car it is fine. If you dont have a car you have to take a very long (almost one hour) mini van in to the city centre and its not the most convenient thing ever. Also there is no ATM near by and you need cash to pay so heads up and bring cash with you!,6.7
Clean and comfortablebasic breakfast Language barrier with staff they dont speak English.,8.3
It is clean Breakfast is very small (I uploaded photo). It is written 10 minutes from the train station. In fact it is minimum 20 minutes by car when there is no traffic. When it is traffic - 30 minutes.  The closest market is 10 minutes from hotel (by bus). It is written on the site there is a hair drier in the room. It is not true. You must ask on reception to get a hair drier. Take into account if you need iron on reception can tell you that somebody other took it and he still has not returned it back. They do not accept credit cards in both reception and restaurant. They do not accept foreign currency. So many things different that information they published on the site made me feel not comfortable there.,6.7
 I watched the hotel for reservation starting from 1:00 am in the morning. I had to pay extra for it. But they asked us to put the booking in the previous day (because their computer is not updated the date!!!!!) and had to leave before 12:00 pm next day (flight was in the evening). Do not use this hotel.,1
Theyre nice facilities anyway Nothing I like everything,6
 There was no refrigerator no telephone no minibar no tea or water in the room.The only good thing is location and cleaning.I dont know the other rooms but the room that they gave me its really not like the 3 stars hotel.I didt like the ,4.6
Clean well kept and modern. Rooms are small and with basic furniture but with nice tv set and the bathroom is nice and recently renovated. Window blinds arent thick enough to make a complete dark at night,8.8
the hospitality of the reception they dont have hot water and cup if u want to drink hot water you have to come to the bar everytime you want to drink tea or something and yeah they dont give you tea in the room. no toothbrush nor shampoo so dont expect something nice except the comfy bed.,5.8
Excellent property and staff who managed to make us feel comfortable despite the current restrictions due to Covid-19 ,10
The central location and the nice personnel There is no fridge in the bedroom,10
Best value for money around. Staff was really nice to me. ,8
 Reserved a queen room but got just a standard room. Not very honest. Did not complain because too much in a hurry at arrival.,7.5
Great location and staff. Room comfortable and clean Air conditioning not functioning very well,10
Very nice hotel with very nice lobby bar and in a good location which is walking distance to the EU Institutions and close to Park. Restaurant across the road from hotel is also very good. Coffee facilities and some free water in rooms would be a place for such trips.,8.8
The bed No comfort no bed table no chairs..,4
 Very noisy I didnt sleep all night from the street noises.. Terrible noise isolation,5.4
The location is as central as it can get. The staff were also efficient. Best part has to be the 24x7 restaurant cum bar serving customers through out and possibly the only place in Brussels catering like this perhaps. The courtyard is great as well as the lobby. Its quite a commercial hotel. Even though it is close to the central station expect a trek to the hotel if walking there with heavy luggage. No tea/coffee making facilities in the hotel.,8.3
Nice design of hotel friendly and professional staff. Great location. Comfortable bed. The rooms are nice but could be a bit more complete given the price. They could provide more shampoos etc and more wardrobe space.,9.6
Great location calm but central  Lacking room facilities like ware-drop no fridge no coffee facility no vanity items small room  ,9.2
The 7th floored hotel is welcoming and cozy with a lounge bar nearby the reception. Staff is efficient and kind. The location is 7min to the train station 10min to Grand place by foot and from there you can already go in every tourist spots. My room is always tidy and clean. I love the restaurant Floyds infront of the hotel. I recommend this place and would definitely come back to stay. Unfortunately No mini fridge w/drinks no phone and no coffee machine/electric kettle available inside the room. Dont know if they have room service but I always go down in the bar to get my cold/hot drinks.,9.2
The hotel has a nice location. not too far from the central station and few minutes walking from the city center. i like the style and the general atmosphere of the hotel ,8.3
Well equipped barPerfect location to everything Value for moneyClean comfy rooms  Nothing,9.6
Location- great for Brusselscleancomfortable room and bathroom exellent WIFI very good breakfast. Very slow check in,8.8
 We arrived after midnight we booked a room for 2 person but we got a single room only one towel one blanket.. Was not so comfortable. We called the reception but nothing happened we just got a sorry in morning.,3
Good location very clean and modern  Maybe little bit overpriced,8.3
Near to city nice hotelbar okay breakfast Lots of noise from outside (construction works that the hotel cant influence but a nuicance anyway),8.3
 I requested a double bed and i had two single beds put together which is not a double bed!! So i paid for a double room for nothing!!,7.5
Very good location The room is not clean the hotel smells bad,6.7
Staff - very helpful friendly. Telephone issues.,9
Internet very bad no bar no lobby no room service breakfast in a basement ,7.5
Excellent location to see Brussels Rooms are a bit outdated.,9
 Ac set to 25 degrees far too hot. Windows did open a little but drunk youths partied all night in the plaza outside. Choice between heat and noise.  Either way little sleep.,7.1
Location. This place is right out of Brussels Centraal and two steps from Grand Place. ,8
Location is very good. Room has a nice view. Staff was very friendly to give you a window view to the city on request. Excellent breakfast. Everything packed for hygiene reasons during corona times. This is very minor issue.  We wanted bath bubble for bath tub but unfortunately not available at the hotel.  It would be nice to have these prior especially when there is a bathtub in the room. Also very bad wifi.,8
Close to the center A bit old and outdated,7
The hotel was very centrally located near to the Brussels central train station and provided a reasonablly good breakfast. I enjoyed staying in this hotel although I was offered a single room instead of what I booked as they offered a free breakfast. I booked a double room without breakfast but was offered a single room with breakfast as they said that the room I reserved had a technical problem so accepted to stay in a single room which was just a good size for myself. One problem to stay in this room was smell which was a kind of sewage smell so I had to keep the window open all day long.,8.8
The location was spot on. We had a large furnished balcony that looked out over the central plaza. Parking is under the hotel with lift access to the street and reasonably priced compared to other places we have stayed. There is a large train station/metro nearby although most things are in walking distance. The breakfast was very good with individualised items to guard against coronavirus It seemed to be in need of a refresh.,8
Great location and view Comfortable room Great breakfast Need more lights in room (near desk) Wifi was a bit unstable to connect,8
Perfect location near the Grand Place and the historical city center.Great view of Brussels from the bedroom window. ,9
Great central location parking next door. Dated interior soulless rooms in an otherwise historic building very dated bathrooms. Above all expensive.,6.7
great location.  very nice and helpful hotel staff they responded immediately to any complaint. the rooms were all dusty the internet practically didnt work the power plug was blown. its loud in the evenings even when the window is closed but you also cant demand perfect silence in the city center.,6.7
Location. Drilling and hammering during the morning hours was not appreciated.,7.9
This was not the most modern hotel we ever stayed in but the location is fantastic! A two minute walk from the station and two minutes to the Grand Place. The staff is very friendly and the room was clean and spacious enough. They should however seriously consider updating the rooms - starting with the carpets aircon and beds.,7.5
Excellent help from Tamara at the front desk! Great employee! AC didnt quit work properly,8.3
The location and the staff were soooo kind and friendly and helpful. Location Location Location.,8.8
Location bathroom size of room staff in breakfast  room We had to pay for breakfast. First time in 3 weeks!  We stayed in 6 other hotels and thought our breakfast was included.,7.5
The location is Perfect! A two minute walk from the station and two-three  minutes to the Grand Place. The staff is very friendly  and helpful. Breakfast is delicious and verities !! ,9.2
Location and cleanliness Under construction,7.1
Easy and safe Clean your balcony its dirty.,10
Good breakfast in nice room.   Great location for EU district.  Quiet street. Poor Wi-fi (very slow) for an hotel in EU district.,7.9
 The manager with a very aggressive tone. An error in the reservation was managed in a very un-polite way.,5.8
Price is relativity cheaper than peers and location to commission. Seat on bed was not organised and clean. Equipment is old. Limtited elevators. Room has limited light,6.3
I selected the hotel based on the location close to museums. It was excellent!! The two main museums are at short walk distance. There are good places to have good and cheaper breakfast nearbuy just a few blocks from the museums. I didnt like that you need to ring a bell to have the door opened for you even arriving relatively early in the evening. Sometimes the front desk girl is busy doing another thing and you need to wait out in the cold until she decides to pay attention to you and open the door. I think that a mechanism where you use your room key to open the door might not be difficult to implement.,8.3
Great location modern hotel very clean room very responsive staff excellent service. I highly recommend it! The bathroom is quite small can fit only one person under the shower.  ,9.6
The property was in a perfect location for what we had to do and where we had to go over our weekend. Rooms where spacious and comfy the breakfast was good and the staff members always available to help. ,9
 Noise in the room from the street Smell in the room Facilities and amenities not for 4stars hotel,5.8
Check in was smooth. Staff was friendly alltho person spoke very little english.  Breakfast was good. Room wasnt clean and totally not worth the price per night. The room (a standard one) was way overpriced. Shower was clean bathtub was like 1.50 cm not suitable to bath in.,3
Pleasant helpful staff comfortable well equipped room good location.  Nothing,9.6
Location near metro Walkable distance from center Great staff Multi languages  ,7.9
Clean comfortable near to public transportation Every this is great,9.2
I was not expecting a bathtub so that was amazing! Unique design to each room - great idea and investment! Very clean very quiet great breakfast options. ,9
Everything was amazing great size room great location. Will definitely stay again  ,9.2
 the garage is difficult and not adjusted for business travel,7
Nice and clean. Comfy bed and mattress. Staff was helpful. Location is quite hard to access downtown with public transportation.,8.3
The breakfast was great staff very friendly. Our room was quite noisy we could hear police and ambulance sirens all night,9.2
Everything was just perfect. The staff very kind. Rooms were spacious and clean. Wifi cool. Location perfect. Highly recommend for short and long stays. ,10
 Bad service at the reception. There was no hair conditioner nor other complementary bath amenities in the room. The pillows are really thick and there is no possibility to have others. The mattress is old and uncomfortable. Overall the room furniture was quite worn. No cattle to boil water. The two upper floors are in renovation - lots of noise no electricity in the fitness room. ,3.3
The breakfast was excellent. One of the best in Brussels. Not the most picturesque end of town.,5
Hotel has a nice style with different pieces of art in each room. They took 45 Euro for  breakfast when you dont book breakfast in advance which is around double the price when you book in advance. 20 Euro for a breakfast is already to much even if it is ok. I made the mistake that I did not asked for the price for the breakfast. So I took the risk to get tough questions from my company how I can decide to go for a breakfast for 45 Euro.   :-(,6.3
Everything in the hotel is new and very clean. Great design in the rooms and in the common areas. The breakfast was rich and with quality products. ,10
Spacious room. Modern decoration. Good rich breakfast WiFi was not working. It was unable to log in because a link on a dedicated website was not active. Check-in process took very long.,7.5
Everything was excellent with a great quality of breakfast nothing,10
The bed is great spacious Only the fact that the cleaning lady asking to do the room before 10am in the morning woke us up,8.8
Hotel in bad need of renovation I am used to the Brussels standards but this was exceptionally bad mattress from prison walls like my kids went on them with crayons room dirty I would not think of walking barefooted. And all that for 160$ per night plus 22 breakfast. Hotel in bad need of renovation I am used to the Brussels standards but this was exceptionally bad mattress from prison walls like my kids went on them with crayons room dirty I would not think of walking barefooted. And all that for 160$ per night plus 22$ breakfast.,1
Clean and well approinted room Breakfast is ridiculously expensive,6.7
The secret of this hotel simply is the staff They are incredible if you have a any problem just call misss Lidia ( as i remember) Location 8 mnts walk for brussel noord train station Really i loved this hotel even room service the beautiful old lady she helped me alot Nothing at all,10
The interior was really nice as well as staff and the view :) The doors arent that good so that you can hear every word spoken in the hallway,9
Breakfast was not that exciting. The location was great. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. I was going to give the hotel a lower rating but the front desk staff made me change my mind. Thank you guys for your help in making my stay a happy one. The bathrooms could do with an up grade.,9
Breakfast Dont understand concept of guest and value of hotel guestThe general manager has absolutely no clueAbout customer satisfaction  how to solve simple customer request This is in best case not more than a three star hotel ,2.9
Location not to bad. Around 15 min walk to Grand Place.Great breakfast! Lovely staff great chill out bar massive room with very comfortable bed. When we stayed they had construction going on on the floor above is so every morning we were woke up around 7:30 with loud banging ,9
The room are very specious and comfortable the lobby is nice to hang around with a nice bar. The food in the restaurant is of few choices but good. The neighborhood is not so great. The botanical gardens were closed all the time. My room was located on the street side which was a bit noisy.,8.8
 I thought that the price of the breakfast was excessive for what it was,6.7
The breakfast is great. Very good coffee. Hotel is nearby the old city of Brissels. Wireless LAN did not work for all devices.,7.9
Staff was very friendly and the restaurant provided good options for dinner. The workout room was also spacious and had a good amount of equipment. The decor in the rooms were a bit dated and the sheets and pillows were not the most comfortable. There was also no room service so you have to go down to the restaurant to eat. The location is also not the greatest in terms of sightseeing in the city.,7
Very comfy chair. :) Reception asked multiple times for the booking confirmation because of problems with booking.com. Even called me after the stay. Very unprofessional.,9.2
I enjoyed staying at the NH  Bloom Brussels. The location is in walking distance to the city center and the room was large bright clean and comfortable. The bathroom should be a bit better for the price. It was ok but I was annoyed with the modern sink that was not very functional - probably not an easy one for the cleaning staff either.,9.6
Very spacious room. Very friendly and helpful reception staff.  The air conditioner in the room works very well.  Free drinks at their bar will be offered if you decline daily room clean.  A supermarket is just across the street and more than a few cafe/restaurants are within 5 minute walk. Minibar/fridge is not that cold.,8.3
Personnel was super friendly Noisey rooms. Clearly audible Humming sounds of aircon in the room noise from the street because of older window closings.,7.1
The hotel was awesome! The staff on the reception desk was unfriendly and breakfast wasnt so great,5.8
 I was booking a room at ~23:00 online from the road. In particular I needed a parking. The selected Accor Hotel disposed of one. At 23:30 I get a call from the hotel saying I would get another room in another hotel in Brussels - to do some please come to the initially booked hotel. It was already difficult to find the hotel I have booked due to endless construction areas and one-way-streets. The new hotel was in the pedestrian zone and did not dispose of a parking. It took me 25 min to get there (constructions one-way-streets walking ..). I spent another 30 min to bring my car to a public garage and was in bed at 01:00. The bad rating is due to the fact that a room was offered with a parking and and the end I did not get it as booked. The employees tried to do their best.,1
i like the clean modern feel to the hotel for me the location is ideal staff are always friendly and helpful. The room rate id fine but the extras are too over the top breakfast at 24 euros and car part at 27 euro soon adds up.,9.6
Comfortable and spacious room nice breakfast  ,9
 The breakfast is not comparable to any of my previous NH experiences. Good bread but no smoked salmon not many cooked options.. not really worth,8.3
Great staff lots of sweets everywhere. Very good value One slight niggle was it does take quite a while to make your own waffles as there is only one machine and lots of people wanting to use it,10
Great breakfast buffet though relatively expensive The airco was not really cooling the place. There was no kettle in the room for making tea. Very thick cushions difficult to sleep on.,6.3
Location was good breakfast was perfect. ,10
Breakfast was incredibly good (with plenty vegan options). We enjoyed the gym. The whole hotel had a very nice atmosphere. Our room had an oriental vibe which was very relaxing. The botanic garden is next to the hotel and is really nice. The city center is within walkable distance. The restaurant of the hotel was closed at the time for holidays.,8.8
Abundant breakfast and the self-service waffle machine is definitely a nice touch. Very comfortable bed. The room is simply designed but the hotel interior is quite stylish. Very kind and helpful staff. Basic room amenities and had to ask for dental kits at the reception. Bathroom towels felt a bit old.,9.2
Location - ambience - friendly staff - large clean bedrooms - good shower - taxi rank outside Service in the bar was very poorBreakfast expensive,7.5
Modern room close to metro Cleaning was not meticulous rather rushed checking out even 1 hour late incurs a $10 charge even if room is available. There is no free breakfast contrary to ad on Google and it costs over 20 euros per person.,6.7
The breakfast was very good lots of choice. Location 20 minute walk to centre. ,9.2
Excellent breakfast choice breakfast room service (fee) coffee-/tea facilities in the room spacious room. Restaurants near to hotel ok. Conference facilities & coffee break catering very good. No restaurant hotel has a bar offering cold snacks but closed on Sundays only small choice of sandwiches and cold drinks can be purchased in lobby.,7.5
Staff at reception were very enthusiastic and helpful. Room was big and airy maybe slightly dated bathroom fixtures but everything very clean. Coffee/tea-maker a bonus! Easy to get to from Gare du Nord and within walking distance to Grand Place (15 - 20 mins). Metro station just up the road.  Next door to Botanic Gardens which are lovely laid out. ,7
Great value for money. Comfortable standard double bed room was quite spacious. Personel is great and willing to Help and give any info. Breakfast is great and always refilled. Metro station is very close maybe 150 meters from hotel. ,8.3
The staff are good and helpful The hotel far of centre,6.3
There is a coffee machine inside the room spacious space and two bottles of water. The wall is too thin and you can hear everything from the next room. There are stains on the coffee table. No any hotel facilities instruction in the room and we have no idea where the gym locates and so on.,5.4
Good room and breakfast. Staff at reception all very good compliments to Lydia and Mark. Room service and staff all good too. Really surprised us and we will certainly come back! ,8.8
Good room very clean with good bathroom facilities. Location was excellent it was just a 10-15 minute walk to the centre of Brussels and a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area. $22-25 for breakfast per person is an extremely expensive price.,8.8
Cleanliness It was very far from the center. No room service.,5
Value for money.. Rooms were very clean and Breakfast was excellent.. Check in process was also very smooth. Overall 5 star ,9.6
Staff was very helpful Location not in the best areaLocation outside the hotel was dirty ,7.9
Nice hotel modern design easy access to the city highlights walking reception staff very welcoming  Nice touch the complementary coffee in the lobby Parking can be difficult to find especially coming in a very busy city -for me it helped the hotels photos where I could see the parking sign,10
Breakfast was provided in room as the Coronavirus outbreak. However its very expensive for what it is Breakfast pricing There was no gym facilities available even though the hotel has a gym but never mentioned that it wasnt open when making a booking,4
Clean bright and colourful In general good staff behaviour The waffle counter @ bf  We were 3 in a room. Had requested for a glass and a cup on the day of arrival. Did not get that even after 4 days Service is poorBreakfast was same on all 4 days. That was boring Being Aug Bar and restaurants were closed If you are a tourist it is better to stay near the city centre or Brussels south ,6.7
Own made waffle in the breakfast Powdered milk for the coffee in the room,7.1
Colourful and bright lobby Food on site is limited and no room service.,7.5
Excellent value for money including breakfast large uniquely decorated rooms. ,10
 it was extremly cold in the room when I arrived there. I tried to put the ventilation on 30 degrees but did not help much. Impossible to connect to wifi. The login and password that I got at reception were not compatible with the NH Hotels screen that I was supposed to fill in.,8.3
Location Bar prices and breakfast cost was very expensive for whsy was on offer,9.6
Very comfortable at a reasonable distance from the attractions  ,10
 The room is truly out dated amenities are not working properly. Even the coffee machine is rusted from inside badly.  Hotel needs major updating,5.4
There is in 8 floor hidden gem in shape of a fitness with stunning view on the botanic if you wake up early you cen see beautiful sunrise if the weather is good  The coffe machine did not worked one bed light was broken and the whole system of lightning of the room was very bad and no handmade painting can fix that.,6.7
Very cold room in almost winter Room very cold and staff too,4.2
Location The room old so muchI think their is ghost in room 637,7.9
Centrally located hotel with city center just 15 mins walk. Very well planned and spacious rooms. Breakfast was also good! ,9.2
Personal style and design The room was little bit cold.,10
The breakfast was very good. the staff was very professional and the hotel was overall good There were no slippers bathrobe or toiletries in the room on Wednesday or Thursday,8
Hotel was very clean and close to the city center. There is great access to public transportation right in front of the hotel Parking was really expensive. 27 Euro a night. Theres no reason for parking to cost that much.,7.9
Nice clean lined decor in rooms.  Excellent breakfast and complimentary water station and snacks in lobby. ,8.8
Fun rooms and comfy. . Window Lights poorly placed to glare you  staff difficult and unfriendly,7
Great buffet breakfast Not so clean the bathroom sink was clogged.,5
Mark at reception was very helpful and excelled at providing great customer service. The room smelt smokey (cigarettes) and the mini fridge did not cool.,9.2
Lidia and the Spanish gentleman (usually works night shift) were excellent to deal. They made the experience more memorable. They were easy to talk to and very helpful. The coffee machine (never enough water).  TV - or a lack of  The shower head.,7
Very bad hotel Staff very lost they offered free breakfast and then they told me it will charge me 25 euros,2.9
+ 15 min. walking distance to Grand Place + Nice Breakfast + Big Rooms - It was too warm in the room even-though heating system was off. - Ventilation system in the toilet was working 7/24.,7.9
Exceptional service. Room was a bit dusty.,8.8
 The breakfast should be included and not considered apart form the room accomodation cost,9.6
Stylish and classy with some interesting features. Breakfast was absolutely incredible. One of the best Ive ever had Area is a bit dodgy in fact there were constantly tramps sitting on the wall outside drinking beer and staff seemed to make a number of odd mistakes for example room didnt have extra bed as requested bloke at breakfast misheard by room number and tried to make me pay again! . ,7
Perfect location close to places of interest and restaurants. Not a 4 start hotel. Not as clean as pristine as expected. Will do a good value for money for 3 stars. Loads of scratches on the wall in the room door framesetc. Bathroom shower not cleaned properly( calcar and water marks) drainage from the bathtub no great so water accumulates when showering(yach).. the antislippery thing in the bathtub yellow and sticky(yach)..curtains at the windows horrible..plasticky..fridge not as clean as it should.not 4 stars!,5
Excellent location. Uncomfortable mattress. Every staff member was friendly and polite but the receptionists.,6.7
Such a lovely room and very friendly staff The a/c wasnt working properly and it was a bit warm sometimes,9
 Clearly a rip-off. Rooms are small and dirty. Carpet in corridor and room is particularly filthy. My room was not cleaned properly toilet and bathroom only marginally cleaned. We all know that chain hotels such as Novotel are not the most classy or stylish but that is compensated by a good price ratio (value for money) but 325 Euro for two nights for a 4 star hotel is definitely not a deal. This hotel is not recommendable definitely NOT for business travellers! (no parking),3
1 - location is good2- rooms are clean3- specious4- check in was classy5- clean5- overall good value for money 1- the room above us were making some noise and we could clearly hear them.2- the pillows werent comfortable 3- view wasnt so good for me,7.9
Comfortable room. Great position. Very helpful staff. ,7.9
 bed and pillows are not the most comfortable,7.5
Breakfast from 6 to 11am is good for early birds like my husband and long sleepers like me:-) Clean room good bed.  Nice hammam and pool. Very friendly lady at check in. Nothing not to like,8.8
Reception staff was not friendly they were not helpful to provide good accomodation. Tecnichal manager defending noisy fancoils in the room fancoils working very noisy no one accepting that is working noisy without control. Breakfast was poor needs more vairety. Staff attiute breakfast and noisy fan coils...,3
 Parking is problem. Difficult to parking spaces in  nearby area.,8
Receptionist Monica was very helpful Pillows are a bit hard,8.8
Location was great near main shopping street. Spacious room with comfy bed. Tried room service once the fish and chips were delicious. ,9.6
The location is perfect and the restaurant/bar is got lots of good options. Pillows were kind of uncomfortable but the room had additional pillows to try in the wardrobe.,8.8
the Hotel is located in the heart of the city clean calm and comfortable. its a good value for the money and the breakfast too. ,7.9
Considering COVID I understand the hotel may not have been in its most prestige place. The best part about the star was the cleanliness. The front desk staff could be a bit more polite and personable simple greetings as we enter or exit Very clean rooms are comfy,8
quality of the welcome and availability of staff very helpful staff at the gourmet restaurant: we were late and the staff accepted to serve us in the restaurant rather than restrict us to the room service breakfast buffet is very crammed too little space for too many people. this resulted into an experience of foodstall (as opposed to a restaurant) quality of pillows is very bad - if there is a single thing that needs changing pillows would come top of the list. no blanket in the cupboard (and fairly thin duvet),7.5
It was really downtown most of the things within walking distance Parking space somewhat remote about 300 m walk to the parking garage,7.5
Central location I was waiting nearly 2 hours for my room..,7.1
Location nice bathroom. No slippers gown for guests. Need to expand the gym and pool area.,7.1
very nice excellent location there was not water in the toilet like other hotels  for washing the toilet like Finland hotels,8.3
The room was standard. The hotel met our request for room with bathtub. Location was good. Aircon did not work. It was near a construction site and we requested that it was a romantic getaway and yet we got a room facing the construction side which was horrible. We could could not open the windows as it got insanely loud. I say avoid this hotel completely till that construction is over.,6
Location was not bad The safe box was not working and I reported it but they didnt fix it.  Moreover the shower was not working! I had to sleep in the tub to take a shower! Also very limited choices in the breakfast and they wanted to charge me Euro 5 for fried eggs which obviously I didnt proceed with the order given that I paid for the breakfast! ,5.4
Corner room with views was large and quiet. Good bed reading lights. Plenty of in-room coffee provided for Nespresso machine. Strange lay-out in a large room. About 1/3 of room bare except for a wardrobe and no illumination. I mentioned to front desk staff but wondered how they would address since could see no electrical outlet in the area and only a dim light over a mirror outside the bathroom. They did nothing.  The toilet is separate in small water closet.  Door opens inward and a challenge for anyone large or not flexible to enter and exit.  One side of the bed was about a foot away from the wall even though there was plenty of room on the other side to allow increase of a foot or more.  The desk/table too could have been larger without crowding.,6.7
Location. I requested far in advance a nice view I didnt get it. Room in the past was probably in better conditions on my stay June 2019 it was a little beat up and the bed rickety.,7.1
The location was great a 5 minute walk from the center comfortable and clean room. Nothing.,9.6
Very toddler friendly! Very nice bohemian area nearby as well as easy access to main tourist areas ,8.3
 My room was giving on an instruction area it was quite noisy in the morning,6.3
Great location (quiet near the city center but not at nosy touristic area) good facilities (big room big shower room) good breakfast (fresh fruits cookies full English breakfast) Nothing,10
Location the rooms were quite sound-proof despite having constructions in front of it.  The rooms look dated and the baby cot furnished wasnt a real baby cot. It looked like a make shift cot from a laundry trolley. The baby cot were also unfurnished despite being requested before our stay,7.1
 Doing a huge construction just in front of hotel,4.2
Great location. Friendly helpful staff. Good choice for breakfast. Good bar. Comfortable room. ,10
 Negative:No slippers Separete toilet without any sink or towelsNo conditionerNo sewing kit,5.4
Clean large room. Good location Room was far too hot. Air conditioning did nothing had to open the window fully and still wasnt cold. ,7
Very close to the city centerSpacious room Very expensive breakfastAll in all very good but they lose points in the details eg:Cleaning of the room was not adequate they forgot to remove the used cups to put shampoos to clean the mirrorThere was no toilet brush (pigalle)We would like the water in the bath to be hotter No balcony ,8.3
The working Staff is very friendly. The rooms were very clean. Breakfast was packend. But it was more than enough. The Toilet is very disgusting. It smelt too much urine as if it is a public toilet. Very dirty. Since i was travelling with a small Kid. Very bad.,7
Perfect location.Good sauna.Poor swimming pool very small unable to swim and not than warm to actually swim.Room bathroom was small and the walls and carpet were not what expected for the price. Poor swimming pool very small unable to swim and not that warm to actually relax.Bathroom was small and the walls and carpet were not what expected for the price.,7.5
It was well safe for the covid19 The staff was opening the door without knocking  it happened more than 4 times and always escuses ,8
The location big room and staff They need to provide water every morning,8.8
Everything. Very helpful staff. It rained a lot and they lend us umbrellas. Provided a map and information to visit places around as well as bu local transportation. Nice rooms. Nice location,10
Location is great staff are lovely but the bar and restaurant are boring and lacking character or atmosphere!  ,9.2
the location was for this trip excellent. That the television could not give us the dutch speaking channels and could not be fixed Eggs and bacon at breakfast were rather cold  the bed was rather small,6.7
 Thank you for a beautiful baby cot for my little baby son .. it will be rather my last stay in your hotel. Unfortunately but such things should never happen. Turning a dirty laundry basket into a baby cot is too much for me. I will not even write about the issue of child safety in such a cot where all the edges are sharp and made of metal.,5.4
The location is unbeatable for central Charleroi. Breakfast is not up to what I expect of Novotel and not as good as other Novotels.,5.8
Nothing I arrived at hotel at 00.30.I left the car in front of hotel.At 4.32 somebody broke my car.(broke driver windows)and stoled same bags from my car.It is not possible this situation hapen in a front of 4 stars hotel.Poor security in the area in the night. Never go there if you don t want to spend 1550 euro ( reparations replacing windows)for the night.Nobody from the hotel want to help me with that situation.,3.3
Dont go on a Saturday the mall is closed at 7 and the town is all ready to sleep at 10 Its okay,8
Great experience beautiful rooms very nice restaurant and tasty food. Staff was very helpful with all our requests.  Best choice for proximity to Charleroi Airport! ,10
Very nice staff .Everyone very helpful.Very limited food because of covid19 .Gym closed.Nice comfortable hotel. Stains on the bedroom wall.,9
Very nice room comfy bed the TV and the facilities were excellent ! Shower was very comfortable ! The toilet paper scrubs too much :-( Few coffee/thee for multiple days stay also the shampoo/shower gel The heating doesnt work so good takes a long time to heat and never reached 21+ degrees,8
Location central Getting to it at night,8.8
Comfy bed. Modern room. Large TV with English channels. Bar area and staff were pleasant. Child bed not made up on aarival. Only 1 caffeinated coffee. No hair conditioner.  Lots of stains on the carpet.,7
Suite are big and wifi is good Beds are comfortable  Poor service use COVID as an excuse to not give value. You need to pick up your breakfast down 1 shower gelFor 4 etc For 230 per night service is terrible ,7
Clean Good location  Paper cups in your room for coffee Its a four star hotel not two star Two coffee sachets one tea sachets Cant enter hotel in the evening First call reception While you wait in the rain ,6.3
Cleanliness infrastructures attention of the staff and the location. Super modern room nice view!  The only ¬´less than excellent¬†¬ª point is the breakfast a bit too standard. ,9
Friendy staff clean place quiet and nice. ,9
Large and comfy room and bathroom very new and clean  Staff was cold,9.2
Location in the new shopping mall makes it comfy for shopping. The hotel is new so everything still feels fresh and clean. The windows cant open at all and I missed the fresh air. Pillows are very thick and no alternative available. Breakfast price is too high. Parking adress is different than hotel adress: property should mention it directly at booking moment so thats clear.,6.7
Great location. Sofa bed a bit hard. But room very nice,9.2
Very friendly personell at the reception the terrace and the pool is very neat. there was nothing I didnt like,10
The location was excellent the breakfast delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful. The acommodation rooms are looking a bit tired and could do with upgrading,9.6
It was nice staying out at Belgium Nothing,10
It needs to be more clean. But it is in an excellent location and the staff was very friendly!!! ,7
Nice location friendly staff  Rooms were worn and not so clean,3
The location Requested an upgrade because superior room w sofabed was so cramped and dark. Girl at reception accomodated friendly. But hygiene in the ecexutive room was repulsive dog hairs on the carpet even after mentioning to staff when we went out for dinner and came back were still there. Bedsheets with stains and 3 out of 4 (all of the kids on sofabed) were ripped. Decor damaged dusty and outdated. Told kids not to touch anything. One of worst hotel stays ever. In the end managed not to pay for upgrade but gentleman who checked us out should not have let us pay at all!,3.8
The location cannot be better in the heart of the city. Great facilities friendly staff.. I only have compliments. ,9
Location and friendly staff. The room was extremely hot. We had to sleep with the window open then all 4 of us woke up to many mosquito bites in the morning.,5
 We were with child. Our room (320) was nearby really loud music from the street. This noise was till 1 a.m. it was awful and reception guy cant help us and give us an advise to wait until 1 am. unbelievable!,3.8
Location was my main priority in the center but away from noise. Reception staff very welcoming. The breakfast area: No allocated seating. No staff help. Room was very cluttered and busy for a family of 3.,7.5
Even though the program fell down the whole day the desk manager did everything to have a fluid check in check out for all the visitors waiting. Great person!  Absolutely nothing,9
Very close to City Center very clean and comfortable room! I would like to come again  ,9.6
very close to the center friendly staffs satisfactory breakfast with a waffle machine(no Omelet though) Superior Double Room is a quite spacious for two persons with excellent cleanliness. definitely parking lot you have to book in advance because of the limited space. And the way in/out is only one route and very narrow that you hardly could enter. My car was a large one(volvo 90) and it was soooo hard to get in and out.,8.8
 The breakfast was expensive for a buffet breakfast but as it was New Year there were limited alternatives.,8.3
Great location right in the middle of historical Gent. Close to tram that goes to business Centre in Gent Zuid. Great breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. Staff are friendly and helpful. Preferred hotel for my business trips in Gent. Taxi service has to be pre-ordered for morning journeys hotel could make this clear in reception area so guests are not caught out.,9
The location was perfect. The staff was helpful. I recommend parking at the Parking Vrijdamarkt. It was clean and reasonably priced. It fit our minivan as well. Just a 3 minute walk from the hotel. The rooms seemed a little dated.,8
Kind staff good location to explore the city. The matrasses where to soft for me but thats person related.,8
Staff is nice Location/rooms/ bugs in rooms/ mosquitos,4.2
The hotel reception restaurants and bar area were all well maintained. Breakfast was a pretty good buffet with a choice of hot and cold food. The room we stayed in was comfortable. The hotel is in a fantastic location with a lot of good bars and restaurants seconds away. The room we stayed in was not quite as well maintained as the other areas of the hotel but this was only minor - it would not stop me from staying here again.,8.3
The hotel was very child friendly. Staff gave our kids little toys and they were very happy.  The room was cozy and we all liked it. Breakfast was very good everyone ate something they like. While we are eating kids could play at the playing area. Thanks for everything ,8
 Unfriendly staff at reception. The air conditioner in the room did not work and the hotel could not repair it. The only way to regulate temperature was to open a window that faces a busy and noisy street. A casino and a night club are next to the hotel.,6.3
Really cheap comparing to others and with good location and very very clean hotel..recommended ,9.2
Breakfast was ok. No real fruit juice though. Would like fruit salad too. But ok. If on road side the noise kept a few people awake,8
Good value. Simple clean comfortable room. Close to metro station ,7.9
Its a big hotel in the suburbs but the area is safe and shops are around and the metro is just steps away from the hotel. We stayed in a standard twin room and it was comfortable with a modern bathroom. Cleanliness very good. For this price I can highly recommend the hotel Orbita We got some street noise from the busy streets around the hotel.,9.6
Location is just OK no special view but close to bus station and main streets. ,7
Parking security. Breakfast is I can teach Cheef how to make breakfast ,5
The price you  pay is perfect deal. Ok Breakfast 9$ per person I think is a lot for Belarus,10
I am a very frequent traveler staying in multiple cities all over the world but the service provided in Orbita was the best all across the locations Ive been in the past. The stuff is the most kind supportive and welcoming Ive ever experienced. The level of professionalism is exceeding all possible expectations. Starting with the support at the reception over to excellent service at cafe and restaurant and to the cleaning service - an amazing experience highly recommended to other travelers. The rooms are causy and well-equipped with brand new electric supplies - boiler and heating system. ,10
This hotel is very close to metro. Also around the hotel some supermarkets and restaurants. Not in center but easy to get go everywhere. Hotel is too old. Its cold 3 stars hotel but it is as 1 star hotel. In entrance there is no bellboy to help your baggage. Inside of the room is too cold and too old furniture and bad. Also when i asked some questions to reception about address registration she just told that she doesnt know it and than i asked from her to ask her manager for information and she told me that today just i work and i dont know anything about it. I do not recommend to anyone to stay there.,3
Clean property good value good location near metro.. Staff should smile more...,9.2
Location as it beside the ballet the ballet school the only reason I return despite awful staff Reception. They dont like tourists!!,4.6
Is there anything to like here apart from a warm room. Very disappointed to have been disturbed by noise next door asked to be moved to a quieter place away from a kids football team. the next night having to wake up at 5.50am i couldnt sleep because of what sounded like a party between two men and woman going on. Decided to get up and just check out at 1am because of it. went down to reception fully dressed and ready to just leave i was given the keys to another room in a more quiet place in the hotel.  i really was not happy about any of this while feeling unwell from a stomach bug id picked up. I have stayed in this hotel many times since 2012 and something always happens there. they really need to step up their game.,1
Good hotel for that money and great staff -,10
Excellent hotel!! More than expected for that money very clean great breakfast.  ,10
Nice room good breakfast and pleasant staff. Stylish hotel. Next to the Berchem train station if arriving by train.  Despite how it appears on booking.com the hotel is inside the Low Emissions Zone if youre coming by car. We were able to find cheap on street parking just a few minutes walk away outside the zone. The centre is a 45 minute walk though there is a tram stop is by the hotel. ,8
 The hotel address should be updated in the website and where needed. Google map can allocate the hotel only at the previous address. Impossible to get a taxi at the hotel for the same reason.,10
 Difficult access by taxi. No heating in room. Staff not very responsive. Dont recommend this hotel,3
Very friendly. Great breakfast. Beautiful rooms. ,10
Well located if you travel by train or fly to Antwerp. ,10
 The stuff were very rude we stayed for 3 nights no one cleaned the rooms and when we talked with stuff they tends to put the mistakes on us and said we put the sign of not disturbing and thats not true we didnt put anything.We informed them from second day that no one clean and still until we checked out the did nothing. In addition to that they raised their voices and insisted to put the mistake on us with out any proof.We regret that we stayed in this hotelAnd Will never recommend it to anyone. ,2.9
Location Shared my room with a family of mosquitoes this week. Double bed was two mattresses so kept on slipping between the two and waking up. No tea or coffee facilities in the room.,4.6
Not a lot Very basic and a bit too far out,6.7
There was enough space in the rooms very clean also. The staff is nice!  The parking was not nearby,10
The mail building is a beautiful period townhouse lovely courtyard excellent location very quiet neighbourhood excellent breakfast very charming hosts No complaints. Our room was a bit hard to access (through courtyard several stairs and over a rooftop) but we were informed in advance about that so it was no big deal and added to the charm,9
 The pictures of the rooms exceed the rooms,7.1
Very clean lovely comfy bed location excellent friendly staff and a coffee machine where you can get a drink any time of the day or night also a fridge with beer and pop which you pay on checkout Too many steps but is no fault of the hotel 1 reception guy said breakfast is to pay for and the other told me it was included in the price personally I think all reception people should know whats what the parking was a little bit out of the way from the hotel at a charge of $15 a day,9.6
It was quite close to town It wasnt really like the pictures and the part of the hotel we were in was more like a youth hostel,5.8
Clean basic good price and an excellent all you can eat buffet dinner on Saturday night ¬£24 - I had five mains including mussels and steak  Kettle and facilities in room would be nice..,7.5
Bed comfortable and room warm. Reception staff good. Nice gardens. Information not in English No tea  and coffee facilities in bedroom. Room signage not clear.,7.9
The staff (one guy who does it all) was very friendly well informed and helpful Room was big and quiet  The hotel has very dark/cold atmosphere  not cozy at all. There is no reception (lobby) just a small desk on the side of the empty bar. The rooms are in separate buildings that we had to walk outside and many stairs. No lift we had to carry bags buggy and baby..Make sure you book a parking space in advance fills up fast we had to park on the street and walk in the rain 5minWas extremely hot inside there is no way to regulate the temperature in the room we kept the window open even tho outside was 2¬∞CFor all this we paid 145$ per night.. wayyyy too expensive shouldnt be more than 50$Will not recommend it ,6.3
Very good breakfast.Very good location.  Some constructive details reveal a lack o maintenance.On the bedroom the curtains were smaller than windows. ,7.9
Cabin on wiew river Just receiption closeI wait little bit consierge for entrance.,9
Nice room all the way in the back of the building airco view on the river. Great receptionist. Parking your car is 600m walk in a different parking garage. But at least it was possible.,9.6
In the short time I was there I was particularly impresed with the ease and quality of service. A nice relaxed kind of high service. Furthermore on the service we found his quality of directions and tips quite helpfull easy to understand and of high quality. This being an anniversary trip with my girlfriend. I found it regretable that due the our matresses drifting apart with remarkable ease it was quite hard to hug her.,7
The receptionist was very nice and helpful. The room and bathroom are a bit small.,8
 very beautiful neighbourhood  large and lovely gardenexcellent breakfast with a lots of variety.,8
Not dat doen centrum Gent Floors are wood and old and every step made a cracking sound and beds as well toilett makes really loud noise when flushing when bus passes the entire room shakes and temperature not able to control.,5
Location in a quiet street. Great service. ,8
french speaking reception-very friendly staff-location-parking available (12.5 eur per day) Our room was a twin bed on last floor nearby the lift and next to the room broom closets so it was very noisy but not their fault if hotel walls are thin :),7
Big room with big and comfortable bed. Lovely backyard ,9.6
This is the second time we have visited and have enjoyed just relaxing and strolling through de panne..The hotel does need a little attention in some areas but on the whole a warm welcome feel. The weather wasnt on our side this visit so we played monopoly in the bar with our 13year oldone afternoon he loved it! Complimentary crisps with our Belgium beers and coke. Very cosy bar area. Lovely breakfast in the morning an overall lovely stay. Xx ,8.3
The hotel is centrally located. Very nice breakfast. Pleasant bar area downstairs. The decor is dated net curtains not very clean in greyish colour.  Staff not very welcoming and friendly both front and back office. ,7.1
Location Style Breakfast expensive Much noise Broken air-conditon  Expensive for the little room,6.3
Good vibe in the central area. Nice spacious room. A bit smelly.,7.5
The location is good all hot spots are easy to reach.Friendly staff.Room has a great size.The hotel bar has a wide range of drinks and they are not frugal with the alcohol in the cocktails. The shower cubicle and small shower head are full of mold.The room is very noisy (noise from the hallway the room next door and outside).  The pillow was very weak / thin.The air conditioning makes a lot of noise.The hotel does nothing special when you are staying during your birthday.The carpeting in the hall is very dirty.The parking places in the parking garage are very small and it is poorly lit.,5.8
Clean and comfy and reasonably priced. Loved 3:00 pm check-out on Sundays :) ,8.8
Location was perfect I din t like the stule of the hotel to dark,7.1
Arrived early and went to leave our bags. They allowed us to check in early which was a bonus. Friendly and helpful staff. ,10
Breakfast was great room was very comfortable bathroom also good. Nothing to complain. Maybe the parking was too expensive 20-EUR per day but it is in the very city center.,10
 The cost was increased significantly for the festival but the standard of service was poor,5
The TV and entertainment setup the HDMI port etc even in the smallest rooms. Breakfast is ok but expensive. Beds are quite comfortable. Fridge. The bar and the ambience at the lounge/reception. Sinks are very small even in suites. Wardrobe is non conventional It is sometime expensive but not this time. Rest is quite nice really.,9.2
We did not book breakfast to expensiv. Within 100m from the hotel you could take a breakfast at your choice in several places for the half of the hotel price. The hotel is fine for 1-2 day stay but if you are carrying more clothes there was no place (cupboard) to hang them.,8.8
 The price was much too high for the room and the breakfast compared with other hotels of this price.,6.7
Location design big room Clear smell coming from thai restaurant belowBed way too hard,7.5
Bar area was nice Some of the rooms are located directly across the street from one of the busiest student bars in Leuven. Dont expect any sleep if you get one of these rooms. Constant noise until 5am during the week. Wouldve been better off joining the students and sleeping in the street.,5.4
Fast Check in check out Free Wifi disconnects needs full login everytime. Can be more user friendly.,8
Gym 20 euro extra requested for breakfast5 euro for a bottle of water,8
Great location and friendly staff. Breakfast great. Too close to bars where students were noisy every night. Hotel dark and rooms need updating.,6.7
Fantastic location in city centre and handy parking underneath hotel. Decent sized room with option to open window on quiet garden side for fresh air ,7
Great location confortable beds good breakfast connected rooms parking facility many  reastaurants in the area billiard at the reception. Poor wifi key cards not working to open the room outside space in front of the hotel looks really bad. Not the greatest view.,7.9
Great food excellent staff. Our room was very small.,8.8
The Location is great and I liked the style of interior design Looks really fancy. Also the bar was well equipped. I didnt like the fact that I could exactly hear what my neighbour said during calling her mother. I was able to understand every single word. This disturbed my sleep and this is something what made me feel uncomfortable to know my neighbour also does hear what I say during calling someone. you hear every step on the aile while being inside. this is a pitty.,7.5
Location was great very close to all the famous destinations Heating doesnt seem to be working properly. Not only that lights are not working properly and they were on and off for a whole day.,2
The location was perfect-Just a few minutes from the main station. On the 7th floor youll find the reception and a small restaurant where you can take breakfast lunch or dinner. The patio outside has the nicest view of the city centre where you can relax. Cleaning is done once every 4-7 days but anything you need is provided for free. The kitchen was really good with all the things you need on a daily basis. Bathroom and room were big with lots of space and storage. The only thing was that the room was for 3-4 persons but only 2 chairs were provided in the room next to the kitchen table.,9.6
The room was clean and well maintained. All kitchen utensils available. Good location and friendly staff. The 3rd adult sleeps in a sofa. They open the sofa immediately so you can use it as a sofa and its a rather uncomfortable bed.,8
Very close to train station - ideal as i was in Antwerp on public holiday. Restaurants open around station area. Hotel was excellent. Laundry room which was free to use was an added bonus. Very quiet and comfortable ,10
Comfy bed and sofa the kitchen facilities are fairly new and functional. There was no heating in the room the airconditioning had an uplesent odour. There are no wall hooks for coats or other cloaths in the apartment.,8.3
Good location (close to city center and train center) tasty breakfast and friendly staff. ,7.9
Our room was very nice and the location was perfect. But what we enjoyed the most is the kindness of the employees. ,9
Great location friendly and approachable staff. Well furnished room.  I wish the cleaner had come to change the sheets every day.,10
Room was great on the 6th floor and with a balcony. Check-in & check-out without issues personal was friendly and efficient. Hotel is located in the Diamonds district near Central Station Zoo & Stadspark. All other city highlights are within walking distance ,9
Shopping district nearby really nice cafe upstairs! ,9.2
Staffs are very very sympathique! The room was large and well equipped (coffee machine tea good hair drier etc.) clean modern with air conditioning very comfortable to stay few days!  ,9
Staff very kind and professional  Suite bed is very comfortable ! Room was not 100% correct missing wall paint. Some lights dont work..have to be test before please.,8
 Waking up at 7:30 because of the hotel renovation. They were destroying the two rooms next to mine.Too much noise from the street.An advertising placard from the hotel with two strong lights right next to the window illuminating the room all night. There is no hand soap. Some showers flood all your bathroom. Sometimes you have water in the fridge sometimes you dont. Sometimes you have flip flops sometimes you dont. Sometimes you have a towel for drying the dishes sometimes you dont. Etc.Sometimes you find a dirty oven when checking in sometimes you can find the dishwasher machine with dirty dishes inside.,5
The bed was fairly comfortable front of house staff were polite. Nice facilities in the reception area. Close to shops and restaurants.  The room was dusty. The room wasnt well sound proofed and so it was difficult to get my 3 year to sleep on Saturday evening. The breakfast left much to be desired in the morning terms if choice. Lots of building work going on which we were not made aware of beforehand. Rubbish on the balcony.,4.6
The receptionist got a mistake when giving the room but they fixed straight away. The room was very spacious and clean. Located in the heart of Antwerpen. ,8.8
The hotel is close to the city just a few minutes walk The room wasnt really clean toilet was really dirty mold was growing in between the tiles hairs all over the floor stains on the sofabed and the room smelled strange,6.3
Location is central. Roof terrace is good. 24 hr reception. Toiletries are decent. They dont make beds just clean bathroom and nothing else. Poor housekeeping!,7.5
 Necessity to apply for parking vouchers daily.,6
Everything was excellent! Good location around the corner from the station and close to Meir. Comfortable penthouse apartment with good shower and bed as well as oven hob and dishwasher should one wish to self-cater some meals although breakfast snacks etc. are available for purchase. Self-service free laundry with 3 washing machines and driers was really handy. Would recommend  this property highly. Nothing.,10
The place is wide clean and very good close to the railway station and old town. Staff are freindly and helpful. I will come back again Nothing,10
Perfect situation in Antwerpen. Apartment large with terrace. No room service. Breakfast not bad but nearly all food packed.,7
its location is very near the train station with comfortable furniture and modern style the size of the apartment was very small i would actually consider it a normal room the only difference is that it had a small kitchenette which they put directly when u open the door which wasnt very comfortable having a kitchen in the door opening,6.7
Great staff. Receptionist who checked us in was fantastic. ,10
Proximity to train station.Laundry machines for washing and drying for guests to use.Suites very spacious. ,8.8
Much space good beds next to Diamondland which is worth a visit There was no soap the entrance to the parking space is very narrow,7.9
Near city centre No cleaning every day and no kitchen. Expensive compare to an hotel where you have the cleaning included,4.6
Location! Next to the railway station a lot of the restaurants nearby walking distance to the city center. Big and clean room the extra sofa was really helpful (we were traveling with a 5yo). Fresh coffee in the room. When we were checked in staff didnt pay any attention to us for a while it wasnt kind of that you are expecting usually. In the room was a really bad sewer smell we were there just for a couple of nights so decided not to complain,10
Good location nice roof-terrace Appartments not serviced breakfast expensive compared to the choice offered bathroom pretty small & not very clean,7.5
Great setting in an old monastery and on big grounds. Quiet location. The bathroom seat in Gastenkwartier room 1was old and absolutely disgusting. The room as well as the 3 course dinner are much overpriced and not value for money. One (large) bottle of water was 8 euros it took 2 hours for serving the same standard meal to about 20 people who were all there at the same time and though the setting was  nice the meal itself was quite plain. Overall a disappointing experience for the accommidation as well as for the dinner.,4
The breakfast was very good. Plenty of free parking space.The place is amazing buildings are amazing with a lot of charm and history. The unpleasant smell of the room was quite strong. It was clean but this hotel needs a bit of renovation.,7.1
Environmemt Too few people no one in the bat,5
Beautiful location  nice staff good food. Green environment The rooms are not very nice. Thrre was a big stain on my carpet. The fire alarm went off at 1.15 in the night.,7.9
 When I arrived the room was freezing and it took a long time to warm up but there was an extra blanket and the bed was very comfortable.,7.9
Very nice surroundings and quiet It was not possible to eat something when I arrived at 20h,6.3
The beautifully restored premises are a delight Service at dinner was incredibly slow,9
 I did not like the fact that there is no reception .,7
Excellent in check which was late evening. Very clean and tidy. Loads of room with comfortable beds and good bathroom.  ,9.2
Very nice people who run the rooms and the hotel. Special thanks for the guy making the Pizzas in a traditional oven. ,8.3
the location is okay extremely rude staff,1
Alain the host was very accommodating and flexible. Nice restaurant bellow the hotel and really close to the track Nothing. All good it says what it does on the tin. Its a nice room close to the track,9.6
Perfect location directly to the racing circuit ,10
Nice place to stay while you expend the day out ,8
Really clean very nice and helpful staff very comfortable bed ,9
Everything was perfect th hotel is new and modern no table in room,9
Very close to the train station and is a brand new hotel.  Staff were very professional.  Room was small but very clean and quiet.  It was about a 10 minute walk to the centre.  Nice little fitness facility too  photo of gym provided Very minor but need more free weights as the ones provided are a bit light  not much room to use a mat and you have to ask the front desk for a towel ,10
comfortable bed breakfast and location view,8
The staff was very kind & helpful. The room was very spacious & comfortable. The hotel was clean & the bar area was nice to enjoy a drink before bed . The shower did not drain properly. The water went everywhere there was no floor that the water did not go.,9.6
 A double bed was confirmed though 2 singles were provided The view from the room was awful. A dusty parking some antennas and containers..Is this Bruge??I asked to change rooms but it was mentioned the hotel was full and an upgrade was available at an extra 50% charge ,3
Room and installations Staff were not too friendly during breakfast,7
 Bed mattresses too soft and not comfortable,8.3
Good location staff was friendly bed was very comfortable. Although the hotel was empty and we paid for a king room we were first given a standard room on the 1st floor. After questioning we were given another room (exact the same with a bigger bed). The room had no view and there were some humidity marks on the walls and the blinds were dirty. ,7
I have stayed at the hotel many times. It is consistently excellent in all respects Nothing,10
location near work. no bed sheet change for 5 days.poor bar services.poor front desk service.por cleaning (smell pee in the bathroom)soap and shampoo not regulary supplied.breakfast 25 euros and very poor quality of food.,4.2
The staff is very friendly helpful and always do their best to accommodate the guests¬¥ wishes. The room was clean. The food offered by room service is excellent. The hotel has a very good location close to all EU institutions. Definitely a place to return to. ,9
Room cosy and comfortable Swimming pool restriction that was not communicated upfront from the reservation Window broken at the outside,7
It is located next to the EU parliament and next to a train station so that is very convenient for traveling. It is central enough but not in the middle of Brussels so it is quiet. Mathieu at Front Office welcomed us well and there was also a Tunisian concierge who always greeted us. In the F&B Sandra was always a nice host and of help.  A couple of nights were horrible with children running around in corridors such that we couldnt sleep till late. Also the indoor pool area needs refurbishing.,8.8
There was no eating facilities only a small market agoining the hotel. The windows could not be opened for fresh air. If one cooked in the room the smell would stay for days,2
It is an upscale dormitory with studios with kitchens. Excellent gastropub and the supermarket in the building. The gyms equipment is ridiculous and it has no ventilation !,8.8
Easy check-in and check-out without contact people. The personnel gave me clear instructions what I need to do. There are a lot of things to do there to spend of the free time. ,9
Clean convenient location for a work visit to the hospital  Atmosphere was a bit odd with the students living there. Didnt feel like a hotel.,8
Close to Hospital and airport. Grocery store downstairs. ,9
Was clean ! Was expensive price without breakfast !,7.1
Bus stop exactly opposite Not much places where to eat out,8.8
The room was newly decorated and very clean. All good from that point. The electricity in the room did not work neither in toilette or the room it self.  A person from reception could not support either.,5
The property was on point .clean and very spacious. ,10
Close to public transport  IT is a new hotel first 5 floors students dormitory 6 and 7 a hotel. Construction is not finished yet ,7.1
Value for the money There was a lamp but no bulb Some problem with the TV. Switching on and Off of its own finally i have to remove the power to switch it off completely.,7.1
Really nice big rooms with kitchenette including Nespresso coffee maker and fashionable deco. Lovely cafe/restaurant on the ground floor. Issues: bad sewer smell in bathroom windows cant be open fire alarm dysfunction meant 4 alarms in the morning resulting in blockage of lifts for subsequent hours.. not fabulous to go back/from your room on 6th floor with luggage! ,7
 The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I do not have the name of the lady from the check-in she was really great but Alejandro from check-out did also a fantastic job. I can truely reccomend this place.,10
Nothing.. No refund given..COVID 19,1
Perfect location.  Great terrace. The kitchen was well equipped. I really like the humble and cozy decoration of the place. It was clean and big. The rooms were really cold I think the house bigger than it gets heat. ( Also we stayed while the bars/shops were closed because of Covid. I think that in normal times there would be so much noise.),9
Lovely top floor apt with large balcony and views over the city.  Two comfortable bedrooms and well-equipped kitchen. No kettle!  Very small toilet - strange that ensuite bathrooms did not include toilets.  Unfortunately very loud music playing all night - dont know if that happens every night!  No dedicated parking.,8.3
We were very surprised with the apartment. Its very big and very well decorated and taken care of. It was great to have 2 bedrooms each with a bathroom and a large terrace with excellent views. The location made it easy after spending the day in the city. Next to all good restaurants and stores and walking distance from all the major attractions. We parked in an indoor garage opposite for 24 hours for $20.Great that the owner allows pets too! Very comfortable and nice beds.  Given the location next to busy Le Carre which we knew in advance there are a large number of bar/clubs behind the building which all play extremely loud music until 5am. We knew this in advance and so brought ear plugs to sleep (recommended!) but apart from that all good! ,8.8
The apartment was very spacious clean and well-equipped. Central location--albeit a bit sketchy on a Saturday night--near bakeries and restaurants. We maybe just had bad luck..but there was obviously a party in the building the night we stayed. The smell of smoke and noise made sleeping nearly impossible until after 4AM. The apartment was well cared for but the building was not well maintained in the common area.,6.5
Apartment size offers excellent value for money - it has a spacious main bedroom with an en suite and a spacious lounge/dining area. Our host was welcoming and made sure everything was understood despite us speaking different languages. The property is located in an area close to shops bars & restaurants as well as bus routes. It would be better if the windows were thicker glazed to reduce noise from the busy road that the property is located on. There was also noise from a party nearby on the first night we stopped and a window at the main entrance was broken.,7.9
Big apartment great price (probably because of COVID) good location in the center with supermarkets and restaurants nearby Nonfriendly and nonhelpful host 5th floor and small old-style elevator 2 beds are quite small and moving at night nearby parking is quite expensive and costs 205 eur/24 hours.,8
The apartment was very spacious.  Central location.   Two blocks to the parking garage. There were only 2 sets of towels even though I specifically booked for 3 people.  The couch is very old and uncomfortable.  There were a few broken windows.  Being on the top floor it got very hot and had to open the windows and doors but it sits on  a busy street and it became too noisy to sleep with the windows open.  There are two bathrooms with showers but no toilets.  Only 1 toilet.  So the listing is a bit misleading.,6
The crowd were really really friendly and helpful Far away from Namur downtown,7
They were very kind to wait for us despite our late arrival. Perfect studio to rest and fantastic that our doggies were allowed with no problem. ,8.3
Not much. The price was good but standards should be better. The beds were comfortable but one was a futon with little access to it. Having to sit or kneel in the bath for a shower. The key did not come out of the lock in a usual way and this should have been indicated. There was a need for more more paint to have been used. The floor was in need of some better covering.  The crockery was not of an acceptable standard. I think it was the worst place my wife and i have ever stayed in.,4.6
Seb was very welcoming. He owns a lovely old farmhouse with quirky features. The room was a good size and there were facilities for cooking coffee machine etc. We stayed one night with our two small dogs while travelling to Venice Seb did not charge us any extra for the dogs. Due to the rain he even kindly picked us up from the restaurant that we had walked to.  There was nothing to dislike about Serbs studios.,8.8
Convenient location with a car The old and worn out house extremely hot the bedon the floor impossible to take a proper shower as the roof inclination is just above your head the fridge out of the room.,5.4
Seb was very responsive when I emailed him about my arrival time!  He had the room available for me early and made my logistics to arriving at Namur so much easier!  We had parking that was very convenient. Also Seb made me feel right at home gave us dinner recommendations and even invited us to his daughters birthday event.  It was like we were at home!  Thank you!!! ,10
Clean quiet and cozy room birds singing in the morning. Within 30 min walk from the centre of the city. And of course an amazing host. When leaving we accidentally took the keys with us and realised it too late (damn so sorry for that..) and Sebastien took that situation with great understanding. Next time we wont forget the keys I promise :) ,10
Room was lovely bathroom was fantastic Stairs..far too many if you are staying with children. A lift would have been nice,9.6
Location was great the apartment itself as well. We had a problem with the door code and it took us 8 calls and 5 hours to get the proper code.  The customer service lady hanged me the phone twice and once to my girlfriend.,6
The property overall was good & cosy. The staircase was a nightmare & when we asked the staff for help they were being sacastic & rude. The property was overpriced & got treated badly by the staff. ,5.8
Perfect location !!!  I definitely recommend this place if you are planning to hang out in Brussel Center no need to use any transportation. The apartment is nice modern and well appointed a loft look.  Easy communication with the Smartflats Brussel team if you need informations. Everything was perfect for us except that we get the wrong code to get in at first but the problem was resolved after a quick call the Smartflats Brussel team. We also couldnt turn up the sound of the TV but that was detail for us.  Be careful there is a lot of stairs in a long and narrow staircase so the place is not really appropriate to young kids or old or disable people.,9
good location can get to the most sightseeing points by walk. the flat also with a great view very lovely ,9.2
The location was great! Also the layout of the apartments were good for 3 of us. The street noise at night was really loud also it was quite warm and there were no fans in the room.,9.6
Comfortable bed and sofa great location. Although they warn you about the stairs they are like climbing the north face of the Eiger! We are mobile and reasonably agile but the stairs are very steep and multiple flights.  Some of the electrical sockets could do with checking they appear loose.,6.7
Location was nice. Majority of most known chocolatiers has their shops almost next door ( and some of them really next door) to apartments. The nearby square is quite full of people but location at the 3rd floor fade you away from loudness even with open windows. Checkin via email with codes of access instead of keys - nice idea. It was stated in the description that there is not elevator but reality with quite steep and narrow staircase was little bit too much. Definitely wont recommend it to heavy smokers or similar - will be quite a challenge to get upstairs. However it will motivate you to spend more time in the city and come back to apartments only for sleep.,8.8
The apartment is nice clean and spacious. The spot excellent. There is not a lift but this is for most apartments in Brussels.,9.2
- The steps were narrow and hard to climb. Hence I would not recommend this place to any travelers with elderly/ children. Moreover the house was quite dusty. This was not worth price paid.,4.2
Great location very comfortable apartment with wonderful view on Grand Sablon. There was a very strong vinegar-like smell of cleaning detergents that did not go away after airing the place.,8.3
Budget accommodation of a fair standard at a great location They provide a coffee maker but only 2 coffee bags. It is a special kind of bag and you need to go to Lidl to buy them. Considering a whole huge packet of these cost only a couple of Euros couldnt these be provided? The table is not cosy- metallic. The cable for the coffee maker and kettle needs to cross the cooker - I was worried that I would burn the cable.For the price I guess it was fine. ,7.5
Location decoration cleane Too hot needs airco high stairs,7.1
Location location location!  convenient to public transportation and eateries. Housekeeping did good job responding to requests. All Lights were not working curtains were very difficult to open and close requested maintenance to come and fix curtain that came off track and it was not done lighting was poor in shower.,7.9
Relatively large. Even with 6 people it didnt feel too crowded. Excellent location close to central station and the main tourist sights. Very noisy street: cannot sleep with the window open and the smaller bedroom got very warm over night. No ventilation in the toilet. No shower curtain means the bathroom gets flooded. No pan in the kitchen. Wrong internet password was given before arrival.,7
Top location. Inadequate and very slow and poor coordination from the host agency.,7.1
Good location Was in very poor condition damaged doors and     paintwork damaged. Plug sockets hanging out of wall in bedroom foul smell throughout.  Suspected bed bugs multiple bites on arms from both rooms.  Towel rail hanging off wall in bathroom ,3.3
 We had Not warned that they were terrible Staircases with no elevator to get in and also Lack of Black out blind in the Window Leading the terrace so 3 People out of the 5 could Not sleep well,4.6
 The toilet seat was broken. No lock on the toilet door. You could not close the bathroom door without being locked inside. The beds had double duves even if we travelled as single persons. I sent email about need to have the sofa bed done. It was not done. I also called about toilet seat and the need for one more set of blanket and pillow. No reply to anything at all.,5.4
Loved the location. Apartment was spacious and the beds were comfortable.  WiFi worked well and the shower part of the bathroom was good. Furnishings were inadequate because there was only 1 couch and no chairs. The only toilet was in the entrance hall and was very tiny and a person with girth could not use the facilities easily. 52 steps is way more than two flights of step. Pillows were not comfortable. There was no place in the smaller bedroom to put your luggage. It would have been nice to have more than one towel per person when staying for three days. It would be nice to have had paper towels and Kleenex.,6.7
Good location. Key code worked well for our family of 3 Lots of stairsLow beams & doors not good for tall family members,7.5
I stayed at Smartflats Royal in Brussels.  The location is very good the cleanliness of the apartment is also very good fresh towels and bed linen. A small TV a lot of things were missing that would facilitate the use of the apartment i.e. hangers for clothes at the entrance and in the bathroom the photos differ from the appearance of the apartment in reality.,6
Location very central in Brussels What I did not like? Well there was A LOT: - nails sticking out of the floor so your socks got stuck and ripped - sticky stains on the floor - dirty floor your socks were black just walking over it - trash behind the curtains - broken curtains so you could not open them on one window We informed Smartflats about the issues but NOTHING happened.. so the service was also not acceptable.,2
Location Opening door and code ! Too complicate if you are not an expert !,5.8
The stuff on the telephone was very friendly We asked at the day of arrival for a second blanked because there was only one big blanked per bed. Unfortunately it was only on the next day possible to have an extra blacked.,5
 There was no grocery store or anything to buy food beer etc. to bring to the flat within walking distance. The only restaurants around were in the $$$ range.,9.5
 It went well we were able to contact quickly but when we checked out they told us there is water on the mattress and what can happen if you have children and they make a mess. For that reason they have taken my deposit of 150 $ which I cannot find because water dries naturally. I also said this via whatsapp to them they said Its 7 working days after your check-out its automatically so no worry youll have it any days now. But they lied and i did not receive it !!So I wouldnt book this if you had to pay a deposit !!!! They will look for something small to take your deposit anyway !!! ,1
The location was perfect. Spacious open kitchen/ dining areaSeperate toilet away from the bedrooms.  The pillows were very small and one was better quality than another. The floor was dirty we never wear shoes inside either so it was poorly cleaned before us. There was no baking paper or other simple items to make cooking easier. No lock on the bathroom door. ,8
The space and the view. The kitchen wasvgood It was extremely smelly in the entrance and the lift. It was a drainage smell. These spaces were also quite dirty. The lighting on the stairs was broken. The door handle to the apartment is wobbly,5.8
Location. Next to construction site we were not informed of this and could not sleep at all.  Theres no AC so we needed to have the windows open which would led the construction noises -located next to the building- into the room.  Again if we wouldve know about construction this wouldve changed but we were not told!  The facility sits under a fast food restaurant they use the same elevator as the patrons it reeks of grease and beef same goes for the facility.   Also please provide real pillows!,5.8
The common rooms were great! Great (big) space and ambiance! One of the two apartments werent cleaned yet and we next to the appartment was a building site we were woken up between 5 and 6 am! But thanks for the earplugs!,7.9
- spacious apartment with nice view - kitchen looked nice we didnt use it though - washing machine and dryer good Quality  - location of the apartment - super dirty you start to not want to touch the door handles or light switches - undefined spots EVERYWHERE: the couch the seats the bed linen Walls - looks not at all as clean and fresh as on the pictures  - right opposite is a HUGE construction site it is EXTREMELY loud. Work start at 6:00am no chance to sleep with this noise,2
Spacious property There was an issue with an alarm in the building it did not get resolved even after contacting the property owner several times. The alarm kept sounding every once in a while during the night.,7.5
Great locationSpaciousHigh end kitchen Not well maintainedNot mentioning heavy Construction of a building next doorSilicon odor from stairwellSewage odor from bathroom,6.5
The open area in the apartment and his perfect localization. Close to the central station restaurants and city center ! Well once arrived we are surprised by an elevator which is out of service ==> 4 floors to climb two set of stairs to reach one floor  not that funny with our bagages stroller and baby in our arms. (and have to do it each time you go in and out !) The common areas are not clean: sticky floors rubbishs on the hallways and odors. The apartment is clean but needs some finishing : bathrooms spotlights hang from the ceiling cable torn from the socket missing baseboard .,5
easy and safe access  description to enter was good. Location in the center and garage parking within 100m was perfect.  The beds were all Cocomat brand with different hardness - perfect to try.  Building first floor is a good hamburger place and we were hungry - super in Corona times. The master bedroom window was at at inner air duct and the vents were quite noisy. The chair in the dining/kitchen were really old used and torn. The appartement was not updated for a few years but was clean.,7
Huge apartment very near the central station. The common areas of the building are filthy. They bring all the trash bags in the elevators and leave the liquids that sip out and food left overs all over the floor and walls (I have pictures to prove it) the smell is like body decomposition.. I have never felt this nauseated over a smell in my life. We just had to use the stairs all the way to the 5th floor. the cleaning ladies use our apartment (501) as a storage (they never cleaned it which we knew) so you have zero privacy in the common areas.,7.1
It was spacious There were a few things broken,7
Beautiful appartment. High ceiling. Huge bed. To get into the building you have to enter a code which not always working even if its correct. Its always smells bad on the first floor and in elevator. The appartment itself are nice but there are a couple of problems. Firstly the heating system is really strange so mostly it was cold inside. Secondly there is no modem in that appartment (Im talking about penthouse) probably another appartment on the 6th floor has it. It means that you can catch a signal in the kitchen only. And its really slow 6MB/s. Finally no one tell us that there is a huge construction 5 meters from this building. So it was extremely loud from 6:40am till evening. It will be there for next 4-5 month I guess. ,7.1
Location fantastic easy to get to Weather so hot no aircon which isnt a problem but think fans could have been supplied knowing how the weather was,6.7
Nothing then issues we had make the experience very awful  The next building in front of the apartment it was very noisy from 6am until 17h. Smartflats already knew it in advance and did not communicated to us . Very bad management from them. A part of that the apartment had low maintenance and we had issues with the shower lights fussed dishwasher did not work windows broken..,3.8
Great location and very spacious apartment. Checkin via the codes was smooth. The window insulation has its limitations. The bedroom at the streetside was quite noisy (we were at the fourth floor). The bedroom at the interior was very quiet.Some parts of the accomodation are a bit run down. Our room e.g. had no functioning curtains and some appliances miss a button or two (but still worked).Overall I can recommend this place.,8.3
The apartment location is excellent.  Love the washing machine and dryer.  It really helps!! There is no air conditioning so we have to open the window but then there are lots of mosquitos so that was not very pleasant as we have to get up all night to try to kill them.  So maybe window screen to avoid bugs coming in?! Other then that everything is perfect!,9.2
Big and beautiful room with amazing balcony and view. No ventilation except with windows or doors wide open. If open sound was deafening and mosquitoes were intense. The smell coming from the bathroom drains was disgusting - there were no additional towels toilet paper or other amenities provided for a 4 nite stay. Entrance and lifts looked to be last cleaned in the 80s.,4.6
The apartment was large and spacious Smell of septic from drains some furniture stained or dirty no mattress cover in one bedroom dvd player not working and not fixed during stay request for parking and baby cot not addressed until I called 3 days before stay and then they werent able to accommodate cot request and loud construction opposite flat which will continue for some time,5.8
 The smell in the entry way /lift. The unit needed a bit mote of a homely fell. It reminds me of staying in a hostel again.,6
 the apartment is very spacious and clean only with the detail that they claim to be two rooms and it is only one. Also counting not being able to enjoy the internet on the upper floor thanking the attention given I am still pleasantly pleased with its facilities ,6
The actual room looked nice. Not the cleanest but its nice to be in the middle of the city. It seems like a good value but once you actually arrive and see the trash next to the elevator the dirty building broken entry door (every one has access to the building).. You start reconsidering paying $240 for 2 nights + $300 waranty for whats basically a 2 room motel. ,4
The flat is great. original and fun. Its big clean and in position A. We loved Antwrep and despite the fire alarm going off in the building on our first morningwhich kind of ruined the day for my already tired elderly partner we shopped and cooked and walked. Loved the baroque and the modern. Youre wrong not to provide salt pepper and oil. It would cost nothing.Its a very lovely kitchen for cooks.Lids for pans would be good too..If youd prefer us not to cook why put in such a great kitchen? Why not allow people to use the washing machine by providing a tablet or two. Tell people that the shop on the ground floor is big and red and called 5 Guys and the door to smartflats is right there!Were in a new city and need big signs.,7.5
The place was not as pretty and amazing looking as the pictures suggest.  but overall for the price it was good value for money - the location was great and the check in was super easy.  despite the location it felt very safe. The sofa etc was not quite clean and the kitchen was only equiped with the minimum such as 4 plates 4 glasses  like the rest of the house really: 1 towel per person and only one bedside light per room.  it wasnt a problem but just gave a feeling of only providing the basics.,6
Perfect location. Big appartment. The property was not smelling great. The wooden floor was in a very bad condition. The appartment looked way better than it did on the picture.,4.6
Liked the appartment loved the bedThe appartment was very big. Liked that alot. Also the location was perfect The hall downstairs was not clean and was very smelly. There were dirty bags in the hall downstairs Also some curtains are missing in the livingroom. The door downstairs was not closing.,8
Big and beautiful apartment all facilities available and close to Antwerp Centraal and the shopping district.  Currently a lot of construction works are being done in the building next to the bedrooms. They work from 7am until 7pm which means that at 7 in the morning they start drilling and welding making a lot of noise. Not so pleasant waking up to on your holiday. ,6.3
The rooms are nicely decorated and very family friendly. You can sit together with a big group and because of the open space everyone is connected. So it doesnt matter wether youre in the kitchen or living room. The public rooms were not clean and there was a very bad smell (We needed to hold our breaths during the elevator ride). I was surprised about the differences in atmosphere between the rooms and the public spaces. The public spaces can use an upgrade it is your first impression and that can be improved.,7
nothing I do not recommend they are the worst worst,1
The check in was smooth and secured the flat is HUGE and close by walking to the central bus station and close to everything. Maybe a device against mosquitos would have been nice.,9.6
The location is perfect for visiting. Near all attraction plus near a supermarket and restaurants stores. The apartment is spacious and has the essentials for a comfortable stay Would be nice to be able to leave your suitcases somewhere for an early or late arrival even for a fee. early arrival or late departure are expensive and this not being a hotel you cannot leave your suitcases and take advantage of your stay. The pillows are not great and a few more plates and cups would be appreciated.,7
Nice location clean and spacious apartment  Very warm but with 30 degrees outside that is understandable ,8
Good place where to relax after a day of work during the Corona time. The apartment is placed in the middle of the city: daily necessities are very close by and there are quite a few parking garages to choose from (they have to be paid separately). I had two minor inconveniences during my stay: the dishwasher was not working and it was not possible to fix it during my stay. There was no door on the shower stall (I think its like this by design) and I had to buy a mop to dry the bathroom floor. Regardless of the minor inconveniences I am going to use a smartflats apartment again if the opportunity arises.,7
Location in the centre of Liege Not enough light,6
spacious rooms the code through the door to get in from the street was just so longgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg,10
Full apartment good location in city center The sofa is also a bed but therefore its really uncomfortable.During my stay and probably a few more weeks at least there are people renovating a building across the steet: a lot of noise starting at 7 am. ,7.1
Mostly everything :) A bit noise from the neighbours late at night.,10
Apartment was spacious and the location was fantastic. Nice size bedrooms. Only one toilet which for a family of 4 was not great. Also no shower mat so it was very slippy. Could have been cleaner.,7.1
Spacious Apartment needs a few repairs.,8.3
Nice spacious place. The proximity to shops transport makes it excellent to go around  Sometimes the scent coming from the sink,9
Location is great Apartment was a bit tired looking and not quite as nice as the pictures. We were woken up a few times by noise from nearby bars and people coming home to the apartments below us.,7.5
spaciousness of the entire flat.  Large bathroom modern efficient decor. Bed was way too firm.  Windows were not soundproof.  The square was very noisy and rowdy with noise being heard from streets in the middle of the night.,8.3
Nothing!!! Place doesnt look like it is in the pictures..they dont have many utensils ..heaters werent working.we slept in the come first night I complained and asked them to change the place but they didnt ..24hrs later they sent someone to come fix the heaters and it worked for only a day and thats it rest of the days we slept in the cold ..called their online reception and me complaining they cut the call on me..shower comes slow and hot water goes from warm to cold in 2 minute.DONT BOOK THIS PLACES.!!!not worth the money ..,1
Really good location near the Rue Neuve (pedestrian shopping street) Easy to park our car in underground parking just across the street. Easy procedure to enter and leave the flat 24/24 -7/7.Clean and spacious flat with good WiFi TV and equipped kitchen. Really practical to spend few days in Brussels A mention for the online service (phone or WhatsApp) : quick and efficient answers. ,8
Location  Cleanliness No volume on the tv Not enough pillows  Coffee machine is not worked Not 1 extra cover or pillow and the heating wasnt working in the bathroom!!! When we asked something..they nicely answered..and NO help  On the excuse because of the weekend:(,8
 The fact that access was via steps and the lift from the 3 floor to the 5 floor for bags was not working.There was no indication of this on arrivalDuring the stay I was notified that lift repair personnel will need access in the daytime but they did not arrive,6.7
Great location clean modern up to date. Booked apartment for 4 people but the sofa bed was not made and no bedding was left so couldnt even make the bed myself. Was a mad panic to try and get hold of the apartment so all of us could sleep.There were no trays in the dishwasher so couldnt use it to start with.There were no curtains in the main living area so no privacy and the sunrise woke those sleeping on the sofa bed up.Balcony light was missing with bare wires floating on the wall.,7.9
Perfect location direct in the heart of Antwerpen direct in the Meir. The apartment door works with a code what makes pretty easy to check in. The apartament has great large rooms with everything we need for a short stay. It was clean and airy. It could use a bit of love though. the apartament lacks in love to detail no sockets in the kitchen the sofa bed did not open properly (and we needed it because we are a family of 5 and there was 2 double beds and one sofa bed) there was watermarks everywhere in the bathroom and in the kitchen.. small details that when remedied would make for a great apartment,7
Great location easy self check-in thanks to staff care highly recommended for stay!  ,8.3
Nice aportment on great location It is on the 4 flore with no elevator,8.3
 The appartment was very dirty.There were stains on the pillows and the linnen.There were large brown stains on the carpet.The appartment had a strong smell of cigarettes and liquor.I didnt want to stay anymore but had no other choice.,1
 A little noise with the neighbors but after having contacted the reception the neighbors stopped.,10
Very clean apartment. I could stay here for a couple days maybe even weeks if I had to. Bed was ok and very clean as well. Even the sofa in the living room was made although I didnt need it. Easily sleeps 4 ppl (2+2). I didnt really mind the stairs to the 5th floor. Unfortunately there were NO towels in the bathroom. Just one floor towel and one small hand towel in the toilet. So that was a bummer after the shower .. Oh and a bottle of handsoap is not shower soap ..,6
The location is good the room is beautiful and it have a perfect spot to take photographs of the sunset. The 5th bed (the sofa) was terrible and there was no curtain in one of the bedrooms. There is no lift too and we need to take all the luggage upstairs until the 3th floor where there is a cargo lift up to the 5th floor. Tiresome.The left rooms has a lamp broken too.,9
The apartment is located centrally at the main shoppfing street and only 10 walking-minutes away from the train station. Self-check-in (doorkey are sent by email). Clean and spacious rooms. Highly recommend the apartment! No elevator available.,8.8
I would like them to refund our money  vety poor services.  2nd apartment was on over 10 flights of starecase then place toilet one only hasnt cleaned gor like 6 months sewage smells every where toilet wasnt flushed for months with excret on it.  Bath was not working after I cleaned it. Again sofa bed no sherts nothing   no floor mats bath mats.  The apartment has not got knives folks place was very dirty given the circumstances that it is a pandemic.  There were instances that not got cleaning disinfectant sprays etc. Kettle were very dirty. Towels was very tough ragged old towels not enough towels for 3 adults. Sofa beds didnt have bed covers sheets nothing ! Not got spare clean sheets.  Place was very noisy when you open the front door they were not hot air conditioning or fans. ,2
The location is centric The room was on a 5th floor without an elevator. 110 steps to climb on a steep staircase. This should have been clearly announced. Completely unacceptable for people with reduced mobility of not so good physical condition. Wifi was missing. Basic amenities. Not very clean. Pillows unconfortable. Scarcity of towels. Fire scape ladder a real practical joke! If somebody needs to use it it will be a big risk. Accesible only for acrobats!,3
Location right on the Meir shopping street Apartment was dusty not cleanNo lift not convenient if you have kids and lots of suitcases to carry. There were 3 nails on the wall underneath the sink in the toilet. Extremely dangerous and may cause serious injuries  if you have smaller kids crawling and playing hide and seek. We alert the management they replied saying they would send someone to look at it but no one came during our 10 days stay. It was very hot in the flat. No airco only 1 fan in the entire 2 rooms apartmentDrainage in bathroom was not functioning  bathroom was flooding every time you take shower. ,6.3
Good Location I choose this smartflat because we were in three people and there was 2 double beds and a sofa bed (we did not want to share beds). When I arrive there isnt any sheet or blanket for sofa bed and when I call to smartflat central requesting it they said it was cost extra 25 euros. At the timebecause I did not have to book another hotel I agree with extra cost but if you are going to book this flat it is better to verify all things included before go. It was assumed by flat that we were going to share beds but none of us were a couple so this extra charge should not be done,7.9
love the place and how it closed to the surroundings! the heater was off for a while in our first day and when we tried to get in the street code didnt work. were waiting with 2 yo child for like 15 min outside.,6.7
 The apartment is clean and spacious but you need to complete some shortcomings and care such as shelves in bathrooms and hangers.  Some of the basics for the kitchen maintenance of bathroom floor changing pillows for the bed setting a table beside the bed and lighting in the bedroom in general the apartment is good and I would recommend living in it.,8
Location is great. Walking distance from the metro and the Grand Place. There are also restaurants and shops nearby.  Lay out of the apartment is simple and yet functional. Minimalist yet modern. The lounge is also accessible. You can leave your luggage if you arrive earlier or leave later. They are also friendly and can speak English fluently. The sofa bed wasnt comfortable. The 2nd room by the stairs has little light. The shower cant be locked and has frosted glass which can make it uncomfortable when youre staying with friends of the opposite sex since you can see it from the 1st room. Wifi in the room does not work but we can still access wifi from the lounge.,8.3
The apartment was spacious and very good access to city centre. The noise of traffic all night long. I recommend more double glazing. Also the curtains did not cut out all the street light - slightly wider curtains is all that would be required.,7.5
Location.Apartment. Fridge not working. Requested a fix.Was Told someone will come next day to check. No one turned up.Next day 2nd request. Told someone will come next day. Told could use office fridge.We paid for an apartment with working appliance for 2 nights.Unable to stay in to eat drink.No compensation given.Unacceptable and unfair to travellers.,7.1
The appartement was nice and cosy. Smartflat has a bad customer service.I booked online via booking.com and I paid for my staying. Then two day before my staying they contacted me through WhatsApp asking me to pay an additional cost of $ 15000 as warranty (deposit money) So I had to fix that asap to confirm my staying cause if I didnt my reservation would be cancelled and I would loose my money I already paid.So I did everything. Now 3 weeks later Im calling texting their customer service to get my warrant (deposit money) back. They not answering or sometimeS when they answer they say that already released my deposit but I havent got it till now. 3 weeks afters. ,1
Nice bedrooms with comfortable beds Shabby impression with damaged wall and very worn down sofa. No bulb/ light in the bathroom remote control did not work and worst the electric code for front door stopped working after 1st day. Not possible to reach 24/7 service Sunday morning by phone. Lived close to Smartflats office so they helped us before their opening hour.,5
the room is very big! my family enjoyed staying here a lot the keyword for the entrance doesnt work,7
Location size and windows that opened easy to check in No lock on shower door needed more lighting in the glass room not enough pillows,9.2
We liked that the door had a code and it was easy to enter and leave the apartment. Also the host left clear instructions how to use everything in the apartment. The apartment was fully equipped and clean. The location is in the city centre close to many shopping and dining places. The metro stop is just a few minutes away on foot. Some furniture is a bit worn out and the bathroom need proper door (instead of the curtain).,9
Hassle-free self check-in with a code no need to make arrangements and time your arrival or stress when delayed. Downtown location very central to shops bars and restaurants. Very spacious and clean. Very good heating and great water pressure which helps to shower the cold away. Quite a lot of noise from the busy street and upstairs neighbour moving around. The sofa bed wasnt comfortable to sit on there could be more and more comfortable seating. Some fixtures and lamps in the bathroom were broken little storage in the bedroom and bathroom. Stingy with the paper-thin pillows and duvet would be good to have an extra one.,7.9
Very good location and very comfortable apartment. Great choice to stay in Brussels! Everything was great!,9
Great location Good value for moneyPerfect for groups Modern apartment Needs a little tlc I.e lick of paint some damaged plug sockets ,7.9
Location is close to the opera really central apartment is spacious (living room) check-in went just well with the codes that I was sent parking is possible in garages nearby (around 14 euros per day) large TV Very minimal kitchen equipment (besides dish washer did not work) not extremely clean bathroom not quite impressive either but hey its really just fine for a short city trip,7
How intimate and comfortable place to stay in My sister and I loved it And Jolly was really welcoming and friendly We had a really good time  ,9.6
Location ideal There was no dishwasher. Also the en suite did not have a toilet.,9.2
Very centrally located. Nice little flat for a short stay.  Shops restaurants etc. all within easy walking distance. Proprietors were dealt with remotely but were pretty efficient in responding to queries. Codes instead of keys was quite handy. Dishwasher was missing (presumably being repaired/replaced?). We could have used a sweeping brush too. A bit overdue for a bit of sprucing up. Some furniture in need of repair/replacement.,7.5
Location is great as it is in the centre. We was let down with the apartment itself. It did not match with the images we had seen on Booking.com. The pictures show a nice apartment but thats not the case. Furniture on the rooftop broken broken glasses and chipped mugs in the cupboard stained sofa wires everywhere broken mirror in the bathroom stained and dirty towels dirty toilets empty handsoaps in the bathroom.,3.8
Living room is big and comfortable! King-size bed is also a Plus! There is no cleaning cloth in kitchen for clean and dry up the dishes tables!The water heating tank is automatic on overnight too noisy if sleeping in sofa-bed!,7.9
Nice kitchen washing machine Mold smell in the hall and in the shower. There were problems with wifi,8.8
The dorm room is big breakfast is good staff are very helpful and hostel location is great just 10 mins walk to city center and a big supermarket nearby. No hairdryer inside the shower room of dorm room or cant borrow it from reception only available in public shower room (wall mount) but it was out of order during my stay.,8.8
Located 23km from Bruges station. Walking distance to Markt. Spacious room and clean. Love the bar in the ground floor. There is a live music and nice place to meet new people.  ,9.2
 you are making the bed. they just give bed sheet and pillow case no towel,6.7
 The staff was kind of rude and didnt care about us just the bar service. at night our room was facing the garden and we couldnt sleep well with the noise that came from the bar. ,5.8
The best hostel i have ever been everything is perfect ,10
Only the location is good I wouldnt come back  FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKES SLEEPING IN NIGHT CLUBS. REALLY NOISY AND THE STAFF IS LIKE 20 YEARS OLD SO ALL THEY CARE IS ABOUT HAVING FUN AND HANG OUT WITH THE DRUNK PEOPLE IN THE BAR. ,3.8
Its clean and the room for 6-bed female dorm is big.  No kitchen. Only one shower room share with everyone in the same floor. No need to wait but sometimes crowded and somebody have to walk a long way to get there. ,7.1
Basically nothing? Yes there is the covid and this is a special situation for everyone but it does not provide all excuses:  - breakfast: no restaurant room so they deliver it to your room..except that i never had mine because the guy at reception told me that he was alone to do reception and deliver breakfast in rooms so he cant do everything at the same time. A big scandal in my opinion.  - bed and seats are 20 years old Awful noise when you move in the your bed (the metallic part below the matrass) The called themselves Luxury hotel but only the price is luxury for the rest..,2
The location of the hotel is perfect as the walk to the workplace tourist attractions are so scenic. The views from the room were wonderful.  The staff - reception bar and room service - were pleasant and helpful. The electric plugs in the rooms were located in the wrong places making them difficult to access.,8.8
Location and rooms. Roof bar would have been nice,9.2
all nice still huge restrictions because of Corona. (beginning of June 21) No room cleaning no breakfast buffet reduced hospitality.. but its not their fault its the rules ,8
Basically what you can expect for the price level. Good room very comfortable bed professional service personnel. Old town within walking distance. Underground stations very close. ,8.8
Good facilities quiet surrounding luxury boutiques very close  Far from the Grand place if going by walking with a child far from the good restaurants ,7.1
Location near the brussels courthouse and the shops of avenue louiseVery friendly and helpful staff much better than the morons of ¬´¬†the hotel¬†¬ª opposite Not much to criticize except the entry escalator that looks a bit old and cranky,8
15min from the city center - nice locationSpacious The room was still dirty so doubtfully it was cleansed properly and this during Covid time..Dead insects stains on the wall and ceilingDirt in the corners of the bathNo hot water in the shower Fridge makes a lot of noiseBad insulation : we can hear when someone is simply walking Noise of dog barking despite the no pet policyExtra info available in the room stated that there would be a kitchen available but noBad curtains,5
 - A rather loud and continuous sound came from the bathroom (probably coming from a ventilation or the water heater) rather unpleasant at night.- no door between the bathroom and the living room.- the pictures on booking are much more clean than the actual place (wall painting and furniture in the bathroom were quite oldish).,7
The guesthouse is perfectly located! All the highlights of Bruges are just 10min away by foot. The room is very cozy and has everything you need! There is even tableware available what makes it a perfect stay during corona! The only downside to the location is the noise from the busy road across the river.,7
Spatious clean room. It had a very romantic touch. The bathroom is also amazing. Perfectly situated for exploring Bruges and a nice view. The small fridge and microwave were also very handy especially during a pandemic. You can hear a lot of sounds from the room. Every time someone flushed you could hear loud sounds. Other than that perfect accommodation ,9
Clean spacious room with additional stuff like cutlery for the Corona times. Dont need to see anyone to get to your room. Very nice stay! No door between the bedroom and restroom.,8
Was very clean. Spacious bathroom as well. Everything was as expected.,8
Spacious room and bathroom with natural light.Comfortable bed.Easy self check-in.15min walk to train station.Glasses mugs bowls plates and cutlery provided.Water boiler + microwave (we did not use them but handy if you need it)Good communication with the guesthouse by email. Walls and floors are very thin. Staying on the 1st floor we could hear the guest from the 2nd floor talking and their music.Check in only after 4pm.,8
The hotel is about 3km away from the railway-station good to reach either by walking or (better) by bus. The distance to the bus halt is about 200m very convenient. The personal is very friendly and try to satisfy all wishes. Our room was on the front side of the hotel where the main street runs past. And underneath our room was the restaurant where karaoke played until midnight. It would be no problem if there were air condition but if you open the window its hard to find sleep. Better look for a room on the back side!,8.8
Clean quiet very good and healthy breakfast. Parking lot small fridge TV. Strange smell in the room. But it vanishes once you open a window.,8.8
The receiption staff  is very nice help me a lot .Really Kind .Nice staff I want to give her 5 stars. ,8.8
Breakfast do not fullfill European standards. We were served with cutlets and Olivier salad. They were out off coffee. Desserts were disgusting. We were the only clients at that morning. During eating while not finished personel began to serve out meals and commanded us to go away. Breakfast were poor. Personal were unpleasant and rude. Such level of services were overvalued. Hotel facility not very exciting. Administration lacks English skills.,4.6
The hotel was a 10 minute walk to the metro. The service is the restaurant was terrible.,9
Friendly staff Super noisy from the street. We travelled with older person and she struggled to enter the shower as she needed to make a big step up to enter.,7.9
Big rooms clean linens comfortable bed Its not the best value for moneyCleaning service took part once for three daysLack of shower gel (at the same moment it was a shampoo),7
Great bar great beer and a good vibe. Some of the cheapest food and drink I experienced in Brugge!  Rooms didnt have decent lockers and shelving for charging phone etc but I wasnt there that much anyway.,9.2
Close to everything  everyone was generally very friendly.  ,8.3
Clean dorms. And a good breakfast they provide. A lot of nossy. I was new years eve. They toilets where not so clean.,7
Good location: in the old town. Though you have to cross the town to get to the train station.The room is very spacious. Every bed has a lamp and sockets to charge the phone. There are big lockers and a couple if chairs. The bathroom was next to the room which also has a washbasin. On the ground floor there is a very nice pub to meet people basically lots of beers and alcohol it also offers pizzas. There is a supermarket nearby. The staff is very friendly. The room is on the first floor and its windows face the street. The sound from the pub below gets muffled into the room so I would say thats not a big deal (at least not for me) but you might hear voices from people on the street leaving the pub.,7.9
The staff was really nice and helpful. Ive missed breakfast as it is only until 10 AM which in my opinion should be changed but the person at the reception recommended me a few good places where to have breakfast. The one I chose from the list was AMAZING!  24/7 reception was the main reason I booked this place. Location is not that good but not bad either. Bruges is a small town so everything is close. The fact that the bathroom was far from the room as well as the fact that there is no soap or some handtowels in the bathroom. I had soap in my room but I really believe there should be basic soap for handwashing. I had a private room so I was expecting more.,7.1
Bed was good enough to have a good and deep sleep. Quite and warm surrounding inside the room. Bath and toilet facility was wonderful and warm to through away cold weather. Staffs were nice and quickly answered to my questioins. Table in the restaurant was quite good for having meals. It is little bit far from the train station. Check in time is little bit early in the morning at 10am.,9.2
Location was ideal had an early start so didnt have breakfast. All good,7
Vibrant place for backpackers and younth. ,6.7
The room and the fact that you can have multiple activities there due to the bar. The soap was missing at the bathroom.,7
Everything except no kitchen or free bag storage n very far from bus n train station. The beds n pillow privacy curtain power point light were 1 of the best n comfortable Ive ever had in a hostel..no squeaky beds n even tho theres 10 in a room the arrangement of the beds r so good u dont feel it!!! Very good hot showers n large shower stalls with hooks n places for clothes...1 of the rare ones that did!!! No free bag storage n kitchen n not enough coat hooks in the room,7.9
It was clean the price was really good the bar was excellent I didnt like the rules of the fridge because every recepcionist had his own rules.,9.2
Good location comfortable bed not too expensive. Nice bar on the first floor with good atmosphere.  Crowded room not too fresh a bit wore down. It was extremely thin walls and noisy in the hallway the whole night disturbed sleep. ,6.7
Large female only room. Nice cosy downstairs shared dining area. Good breakfast (pay extra). Close to old town. Old bathroom facilities. Shower was terrible had to hold button in entire time to get water to work. No soap. Toilets had no basin to wash hands sanitiser provided instead. No kitchen hot water only provided. Had to pay extra for breakfast however it was worth 4 euros.,7.9
Excellent place. Good beds good showers everything clean and the bar is very nice. ,8.8
Very nice room Not too much choice for breakfast and the swimming pool is not included,6
Top facilities Heating didnt work. It was warmer after I switched it off than before. Also breakfast was average for a hotel of such stature. Although if I didnt ask I wouldnt have known that you can order an omlette for yourself at breakfast.,8.3
 Badly maintained hotel many switches not functioning and you have to pay to access the spa !,6.3
Beautiful little balconette gorgeous bathroom and spacious rooms. Lovely staff and building. A few little stains no coffee machine and empty mini bar. ,8
Everything was good location was good for shopping super and normal brands. Lebanese restaurant right at the back. Very safe place. Everything was comforting,10
Friendly and responsive staff Toilet flush kept breaking down due to low water pressure.,8.3
Beautiful hotel Water pressure was to low. Swimming pool not included in price.,7.5
Location is perfect and the hotel is beautiful! All the staff are super welcoming and friendly we even received 2 complimentary cocktails in the bar. I very much enjoyed my stay. I would definitely return and recommend it to friends. The swimming pool and spa is not owned by the hotel and can therefore only be utilised with extra charges.,9.6
 My room was very dusty. All the shelves had dust on them like there was not cleaned for 2weeks or so.,7.9
The entire experience was amazing - cant wait for my next stay Everything to be honest - the food was amazing especially the breakfast - ty so so much,10
The breakfast was perfect! Lots of choices. The location was excellent as well near public transportations and shopping district. Also we received complimentary cocktails after weve explained to the staff that we were celebrating our friends departure to Dubai! Thank you for the very kind staff ! Too bad that the Spa was an extra 30$ and closed early.,9
Nice Reciption area. Request a can opener for baby food. Couldnt provide it. Sometimes they forget toilet paper coffee etc,4.6
staffs are accomodating! classic & classy! really a 5 star! ,7.5
Food qualityLocation To much time to attend at restaurant. 1 hour to make one order. Rude people everywhere. Old apartment. Pool crowded from people of the gym (nothing to do with hotel),1
Good size roomVery good breakfast Pint of OJ and lemonade $10!!!$25 to access the swimming poolNo parking but do have a public one next door,6.7
Couldnt fault the service or accommodation Nothing it was really great,10
I love these room on the top floor facing the palace de la justice. Phenomenal view over the roofs of Brussels.  The Bar is very nice. The coffee machines were broken two days in a row. Construction in front of the building is never ending. Bottons for elevator are worn.,8.3
I enjoyed. The breakfast restaurant always needs to close 10:30sharp! It should be difficult for guests even your stuff.,7.9
atmosphere in general the small rooms are still comfortable enough airco was broken: according to the receptionist it was because of the warm weather but it wasnt it was broken. one pair of the complimentary slippers were far too small its better when both guests could choose a pair that fits.,7
Hotel location was good. Building had a lot of character. Rooms were clean and luxurious. Stayed in room 204. Thermostat was not functioning room was almost a sauna. Facilities and finishes are starting to look dated and the hotel must be on the brink of losing the fifth star. Cheap toiletries breakfast was average at best. The hotel staff do not greet. Bar staff was very poor and unwelcoming - need a little bit of serving training to improve the finesse.,5
Facility is nice and spa as well. We had a problem paying for our room because the deposit is way too big. It was almost double the price of our room and its impossible to pay with a vpay card. The manager had to be called and we lost more than 1 hour negociating.,7
Location is great!Nice building! Swimming pool is not from the hotel so we had to pay 25$ extra per person per day. Very arrogant and impolite staff at the spa desk first thing they said was to complain at the hotel reception because they dont belong to the hotel.. They misguide people with swimming pool pictures on booking.. small letters than say extra charge ! They should really change this and just say they dont have a swimming pool or make better agreements with the operational company in charge of the spa.. Very disappointing.  ,4
Great breakfast The elevators were half broken and we couldnt get a good signal on any of the tv channels. When we went to aspire for a spa time they didnt tell us they had water gymnastics on which really ruined an hour of our stay at the spa. They should have informed us about It beforehand.,8.3
The staff was very professional and they make everything to make you comfortable I truly recommand this hotel Nothing,8.8
always a great place to stay. The rooms are wonderful and although the hotel gym is not good at all one can pay to use the spa downstairs. I would suggest giving guests a discounted rate or not charging though The only issue I have with the hotel is that in the rooms the coffee cups they provide are too small and they all only provide plastic stirrers for the coffee. In a world where we are trying to stop the use of single use plastics this is not at all in tune with the times,10
Not my first time there but worst time . TV: all HD channels are not proper working blocked or full with mosaic pictures Bathroom: who cant clothe it proper.Room door: the moment you have a draft its clappingWC: Water flasher was not working properi did mentioned the tv matter 3times at the reception but nothing betteri did called saturday late afternoon the reception 2times from the room. no response my room: 606 avoid the 5th floori go back to Hilton Grande Place its much better. While I checked out no commercial bargain or so proposed. As I asked the lady for the price from the 11-13tge of decembre Eur 260 per night so no being sorry we offer y a good priceSorry to say  ,7.1
Great location very central. Excellent service st check in & check out very clean rooms superb bathroom The bar staff was rude :( the dog fee is the most expense Ive seen at any 5* or 4* hotel (50$ per night),9.6
The room the location the friendly staff the bar The tea they serve at breakfast (Earl Grey) was tastelesss,8
loved it all. enjoyed stay. brekkie was good. bedroom was nice. was allowed to check in early which was ideal for us. view was nice and hotel was beautiful. the gym was small and didnt like many of the machines. it never had any water when there were cups and it never had cups when there was water. thats my only gripe.,7.1
 Rooms were cold there was problem with air condition. And they didnt solve problem in three days. We got sick because of cold. ,5.5
welcome excellent. rooms excellent swimming pool had to be reserved and was small,9
Cleanness courtesy and kindness of the staff. Everybody  from the entrance to the reception desk makes you feel welcome. I got there early and to my surprise my room was ready!!! I had to change my keys 3 times. For some strange reasons my keys kept deactivating. It was just a small annoyance because everything else was perfect.,9.2
Excellent location classic hotel very convenient ,9.6
Location hotel building and specious suite rooms Looks like hotel is under staff specially when you arrive at night only 1 bellboy we waited long time for our car and baggages to be collected. Reception Staff are unfriendly poor buffet for five star hotel. One time we asked for extra water bottles for our young kids they refused and suggested to use mini bar instead which I find it outrageous as none of our hotels we stayed refused such request in fact they were offering us without asking. ,6.3
everything was greater than we expected. There are enough parking space under the hotel. Breakfast was not excellent we expected much more but it was not. However I can say its high level.,8.8
No ve No vegan alternative including juice or fruit.,6
The location is superb. Right at the beach! Staff is friendly. Breakfast is good. Room looking over the boulevard and beach and spacious enough. Clean. The place needs an update/modernization. Little run down in terms of carpet and painting in the rooms and corridors.,7.5
Really good breakfast and excellent views from our room. The restaurant at the hotel was also very good. The staff was very friendly as well. Fairly clean room as well. Overall the value for money is good. No parking on site despite of that being advertised on booking.com. Its not a big deal since theres free parking in town. But we went there in March. Finding a free parking spot in High summer season might be more complicated.,7.9
The location is very good right on the sea side good breakfast with a view. The rooms are in very bad condition used fourniture old design. ,7
the situation breakfast is very good. hotel say we dont take american express Ive call American Express and Amex say me the accept the credit card. Not professionnal.,8.3
 The kind of shower + the pressure of water,7.5
Nice spacious room & bathroom. Seaview room would have been nice -),8
Perfect location - right on the seafront and next to plenty of restaurants cafes etc. A peaceful and pleasant place to stay. I would have preferred that the hotel sent through a copy of the rearranged booking via email just for peace of mind but nevertheless I am happy for their flexibility in rearranging the dates of my stay.,7
The location is perfect (on the beachfront) It is a 2* hotel so expectations are not that high.,7
The location of this hotel is perfect. You simply cannot get closer to the beach and the promenade of De Haan as you are right on it. The rooms are ok but not great and the windows could do with some double insulation (although this of no concern in summer obvilously). The hospitality was good and breakfast was fine. Because of the current Covid measures it is impossible to rate the quality of the restaurant. However if open the view from it would very good. The rooms were ok - but they are really basic and the outfitting shows it age. Again this is not a problem in summer when youre outdoors anyway.,7
medium level Hotel which definitely needs maintenance we had the room at the bottom which seemed to be a veranda in the past renewed in 90th/00th with carpet on the floor spot lights and a nice living area with two couches and a desk but unfortunately not separated from the bed room it was very big but also extremely warm even if outside temperature was 18 ¬∞C likely there was a little portable air-co which supplied to the lack of windows. The toilet was big as well two sinks bathtub but the WC and the bathtub were dirty. Very good breakfast with sea view we really appreciated the smoked salmon very good! lack of window and dirty bathroom,7
De Haan beach area is really nice. Perfect location of the Hotel! Right on the beach. Parking in De Haan is free. The Hotel is not new nor fancy it rather could get a little makeover BUT it was clean the location awesome the staff very friendly and the breakfast buffet was really good and more then enough to eat. ,9.2
Location is amazing. Price is OK with breakfast included. Uncomfy really warm in the room (no AC) and loud outside when window open. Breakfast only served from 8.30 to 9.30AM. Rooms definitely need to be updated (everything from the beds and pillows to the carpets etc..),5.4
The host was nice. It is right beside a lovely beach in a lovely town easily accessible by road or tram. Overall the hotel is in need of a major refurbishment the rooms are old-fashioned and small,4
Staff was very kind helpful and friendly. Beach is 50 meter away. View is nice from the restaurant ,7
The breakfast was good room super clean and exellent location Staff not enough polite. The cleaning lady entered while we were still in the room. And without asking she started arranging and cleaning the room.,7.9
Small hotel/restaurant at the beach. We had the luck that our room had sea-view Excellent location excellent value for money! Older hotel facilities were average. Staff was friendly. Good breakfast buffet. Difficult to find the hotel as it cannot be reached by car. Park your car on the big parking lot for free and walk to the hotel. No reception receive your room key at the bar. Room could be cleaner We tried the restaurant but we were not impressed.,8
The buffet breakfast with the view to the beach - was a fantastic view. The hotel makes their own breads-very delicious. They have 4 course menu with good price. The hotel is at the beach and very nice view from the bedroom. Very kind and friendly staff. Parking spaces are behind the hotel free of charge.  De Haan and its beach promenade is very nice. Easily reachable to small shops and bakeries. This hotel needs 3 stars!  This place is also good for weekends short and long holidays!  We recommend to try this hotel.  We will come back again. Thank you very much! There is nothing to say except the buffet breakfast is open from 8:30 to 9:30 am which is bit short. It would be nice to have breakfast open for about 2 hours at least as the travelers go for holidays or relaxing.,8.8
Nice location with a very nice stuff. Breakfast was good und you have a beautiful view to the beach while eating. In our room it was a little bit to warm.,7
Breakfast great staff and family very kind. ,8.8
Excellent breakfast good variety of choices very professional and courteous staff everything was fresh and of good quality and ample quantities. The restaurant was closed for the day and only one hour was given for the breakfast.,8
Excellent value for money and convenient. Very nice to have a small convenience store nearwhere they sell excellent Aranchini and beer and ice cream.  Staircase a bit narrow. Not suitable for Heffalumps.,10
The room was clean No contact with the Hotel manager except via whatsapp,5
It was  as expected All good Room was neat and clean I did not find the on site parking,7
Nice studio The toilet and also the shower were a bit dirty. The place was cold destite the heatings were on.,5
 Bed super uncomfortable very few kitchen tools no coffee filters no shampoo in the shower very noisy (both outdoor and indoor) very cold when entering no good parking around.,3
Easy self-checkin spacious wifi smart tv fridge basic kitchen equipment. Close to the motorway great for 1 night stay.  There wasnt any bed sheet for the sofa bed no proper pillows for the double bed too. Strange. ,7.5
Excellent location! Excellent people! I will come back for sure! ,10
Very friendly host. Very clean. We liked it a lot! Only shared bathroom downstairs,9.2
Beautyful b&b. Thanks for owner Paul for the late check in. -,9.6
Nice and friendly staff..warm and confortable bed Parking spaces is a problem if you are coming late,8
 The shared bathroom is in another floor and you can only access the bathroom using a very step staircase not suitable for old people. There is no external info indicating that this was a pension. In reality thats not a pension but a particular home where you live with the owners.,5.4
The owner personally made super fresh and tasty breakfast. Quiet and warm room good pillows. The location is 100m from famous Duvel beer brewery. Google maps navigates to wrong place. But the owner was kind to find us and show the route.,8.8
Friendly staff nice House and a Comfortable bed!Everything was available in the room and they make it comfortable for you. Pretty dark stairs and hard to see.,9.2
 If you go on saturday or Sunday its imposible to get there.,5.8
Friendly staff. Comfy bed. Good shower. Good location. I could try and be picky but there was really nothing to fault as we had a great stay.,10
 The rooms smelled of cigarettes and smoke. The hotel was very unclean and not properly maintained. The depiction of hotel in pictures is a completely untrue.,3.3
The location Dirty Kettle  Nearly burned myself while having a shower as the water was boiling. I had to go to reception to fix it.  Smelly pillows/ dirty towels.  Clogged sink. Receptionist doesnt even speak French,5
The staff are OK. Rooms isnt clean WiFi very bad,3
The bed was very comfortable and we had a really nice view of Brussels having Netflix in the room was great and being able to order Ubers for transport was great. Our air con didnt work so it made the room very warm especially at night time. The area the hotel is in is a little bit dodgy so we got Uber everywhere. The shower wasnt very warm either.,8
the best things are the photos on booking is far away from reality location cleaning bed bathroom,1
The room is cozy clean everything works as it should near the tram so really convenient location with loads of other hotels cafes and bars in the area. You get a feeling of being in a dormitory. There were trash from food on the hallway people having parties at 2am in the next room no other facilities except accommodation. Ok for one night but if you wish to stay longer find another option.,5.8
I did not like anything. I did not like anything. It was very dirty smelly dodgy and I felt very unsafe at the hotel. Reality was FAR different from the photos provided and the price performance is scandalous.,2.5
Nothing The area it is situated room was freezing heard everything going on outside. Floor was soaking. Dust everywhere. Only stayed one night paid for 2. Had to find other accommodation. ,2.5
Clean room good location near tram near restaurants and gare du nord station  WiFi was not good in the room (weak signal),7.9
Nice view from seventh floor.Very close to North trainstation  I miss part of glass door from shower.plenty water on The floor after shower Many little things - dirty walls Broken door to bathrooms. Neighborhood of hotel.,4.6
 The room was dirty and wash basin did not work ask for repair and had to wait till morning but never fixed till check out,3.3
Great beds The room needs a deep cleaning,7
NETFLIX view comfortable bed cold  from the closed window and from under the door. Mold in the bathroom dirty kettle from the inside.,7
The room is nice not very safe neighborhood so if you are traveling alone it is better to get to the hotel when it is still bright outside. Nevertheless the hotel is value for money there are breakfast places nearby good transportation connection. ,7
Communicative receptionist willing to help.Nice view. Modern facilities - door bell interactive ticket for cleaning. Right opposide door was a cake shop with delicious cheesecakes. Trolley/tram stop was close. Near (turkish ?) shopping street = cheap clothes. 15 minutes by walk to city centre. The access to terrace wasnt possible it was locked but maybe they will lend you key at the reception. ,9.2
Nothing we liked. There is nothing to say what we didnt like. We didnt like anything in there. They called a taxi for us to go to Brussels Airport and that Taxi rip us off. We found most of the criminals are living over there.,2.9
Nothing. -no shower head -broken hand shower holder -extremely dirty bed -full of dust under bed  -full of dust on phone stand -waited 2 hours longer than the check in time - bed lamps not working - electricity not working on one bed side  - disgusting pillow cases  -toilet product smell all over the room -terrible parking place,1
View from that specific room was really nice! working staff was good! rooms were clean and neat! comfort bed. toiletries and electric kettle with tea/coffee option together with cups were available. hotel location is not central best option for transportation is a tram (stop almost in front of the hotel)  district is not fascinating rooms are not soundproof also was certain ventilation noise during whole night and noise in the bathroom when you switched the light on (light and ventilation was interlinked),5
 Rooms 18 bathroom is unfinished. Its not acceptable to spend 90 $ per night and have a bathroom like this.The bedroom was really cold with quite heat loss. We had to put the air conditioning on 30¬∞ C,5
Location was perfect to get around the clubs and shops Customer service was poor and they didnt have anything at what ever  you asked they didnt have kmt There was no heater and the electric heater wasnt working properly which leave the room cold so u ended sleeping in ur jumper etc. Its good thing we were out most the night not spent the time in there ,4.6
Good lactation 10 min walk to the Brussels North train Station next to the tram station near by  Brabant street every thing was Comfortable Better to have breakfast at every morning,10
The location was good First of all the cleaning of the rooms were bad broken bathroom door and paint falling off there was no milk or creamer kept in the room when next morning I went to ask at reception they had just 4 creamers in the entire property which means only 4 people out of 13 people which we booked had coffee..The beds were joint when we booked a double bed. I am sure you dont want to slee in between the beds.Also when asked for the room to be clean they said there is no staff and will do it tomorrow. I think i own a refund ,3.8
We did not like any thing in this hotel worse area very bad hotel Everything,2.5
Good hotel bad neighbourhood. Too much noise event a 2am ,8.8
 There is no real heater - only the air conditioning,2
The location is not bad it has the right price and the room is large with all the comfort. The reception was not present at all the cleaning service doesnt work properly because the monitor that indicated the cleaning was broken.,6
The location is excellent and reachable by tram to get to the destination in every 5 to planned route In this period of year the road adjacent was under construction but it does not have to do with them.  I really do not get smth wrong it is fine.,10
Its very near from a tram. Also to get to the center city is very near but is recommended not to walk near the nodstation is a complicated zone. The TV has Netflix. The warmer works very good. You can get a room with a sight of the Atomium. The WiFi didnt work the last day I stayed 1st January but it works very good in the lobby. The lobby is small. Sometimes In the midnight is a bit of difficult to fall asleep because there are people yelling in the street.,8.3
Great location 25 minutes by foot to the city center. Room wasnt clean and it was very very cold inside( we were at December) because condition didnt work.,3.8
Location is relatively good and view from upper floors very nice staff was responsive to claims on cleanliness.  No breakfast option offered. Cleanliness - lacking! Floor very dirty hairs on the bed linen tea cups also not clean towels with yellow spots.  The pictures attached show a white towel after having been passed over the floor.,3.8
 The cleanliness inside the room is quite unsatisfied with the floor full of dust the toilet so smelly and some.of the lamp already broken and dont replace. However  the staff is good.,5
They were quick to respond to request Hotel room provided to me was broken. Heating was broken. Shower kettle and some furniture was broken.Though they chaged the room on request i found torn old beedsheets even in changed room.,6
 The cleanness and tidiness was zero i stayed for three nights I was given an upgraded room on the first night as the room i was given upon check in was not cleaned for ages  and that upgrades  room was not cleaned at all on the third day the bed was very comfortable and the administrator was professional ,4.2
Comfy bed and helpful staff Room smelled of cigarette smoke. TV did not work. WIFI terrible. Old and run down.,3.8
Close to the station Didnt feel safe around the station. Almost got pick pocketed.,9.6
Netflix app built into the tv and a good wifi connection. The bed was clean and very comfortable. The area the hotel is in isnt great. And you should bring earplugs because its really easy to hear people walking through the corridors. The shower was ok when I could get the right temperature but it basically had a mind of its own!,7
Only the location. It is near to Central so grand place is 25 minutes by walk Not clean at all,5
Its just a small room with attached bathroom without any standard facilities like telephone iron locker fridge etc. No daily room cleaning Location,5.8
Floors was filthy. Cold room . Pillows cover smelly ,4.2
The bed was excellent and the room was very quiet as it faced the rear courtyard Nothing it was fine,7
The location was good. The room wasnt cleas as it noted .The bathroom had  very big window and it was prety cold .You might freeze while making a shower.,6.3
Quiet place. One window didnt close well. Then cold enter inside. room 423.,7.5
 The heater didnt work.The room is a bit dusty,6
It was a place to stay. the bed was comfortable. Tried to get a hold of the hotel several times but no answer. Very expensive to take a taxi to and from the hotel to the airport. Was told the average cost would be 25 Euros it was instead 40 going there and 50 coming back. Would not recommend the location for that reason.,7
Great value for money Room was of a decent size clean and comfortable.  Nothing really.,7.9
The staff are accommodating. There are tram stations nearby and a lot of stores and restaurants around the area. Its a bit far from the bus station.,8
the view was amazing we were in the 7th floor there is a fresh buzz in the toilet :) they did not refill the  coffee and the boiler was not that clean plus the location of the hotel itself is a a place you can call it poupler,9
Friendly helpful staff close to lots of shops restaurants and a laundromat easy walk to Brussels Noord station or a tram ride to Brussels Centraal clean well maintained room large shower stall No hot water the first night and part of the next day wi-fi wasnt very good in my room,7
 The heater in the room didnt work The bathtub is the tiniest full size bath tub Ive ever seen. Parking is not included in the room fee (20$!),6
Location Poor/cheap design Ugly Bathroom,4
Breakfast was good. Rooms very small dark bathroom small and toilet very very small. No watch no plastic bag for laundry.Closet contained for 2 people 5 hangers!!! Very low ceilings. Old hotel who should not keep the name Palace. The price was Palace.Also Euro 20 /per night as KI supposed was included. In bedroom not enough lights. Bad experience mnever again! See hereabove!,5
Location helpful & friendly staff restaurant Breakfast and room comfort,8
Hotel is situated very well room was spacious and also nicely located. Has seen better days (already 10 years ago) needs definitely renovation. (Almost injured my foot due to a broke tile in the bathroom) Staff in the seafood restaurant and rooftop was very friendly rest of staff was medium. ,5
Great location close to the beach shops and restaurants. Clean rooms renovated bathroom. Breakfast is fine but nothing extraordinary.,9.2
Unfriendly dismissive staff members. Room not ready at booked hour. Heaters on full blast couldnt turn them off. Bad night.,4
Spectacular location in the heart of Knokke The views from the rooftop bar are more then worth the trip. Beautiful hotel reflecting the grandeur of the past. Im sure that after finalising the renovations this will once again be the place to stay in Knokke.  Excellent food and great atmosphere in the seafood restaurant. For fish and seafood lovers a must! Bathrooms are very comfortable and up-to-date. AC is being installed in the rooms and further renovations are scheduled.,8.8
Great location and great food. Rooftopbar has a great view. Would Be Nice if The room could Be a little cooler. No airconditioning unfortunatly.,8.3
Location and parking facilities The rooms are very small,6.7
Nice restaurants inside the hotel and centrally located. 100m to the beach. No aircon available and rooms can get very hot. There is no tea/coffee available in the rooms. Overpriced due to location but service not to highest standard. Many students in the summer helping in restaurants. Breakfast room cheaply decorated.,6.7
Location food There was no airconditioning in the room very poor for this kind of hotel.,7
Ligging is perfect. Hotel zelf is wat verouderd eten was heel lekker !  ,8
Excellent location Very old rooms with dated (and plain plastic) furniture. Dated halls with little light. The hotel needs some urgent refurbishment. Breakfast staff was nice.,4
The location They did not prepare breakfast that they wrote they would do something in their mail.,5.4
The location near to the beach shoos and restaurants. ,6.7
Location and nice restaurant. At arrival welcome is quite cold.,7.5
Big room with a large terrace overlooking the main square of Le Zoute and the sea. Centrally located. Great bar on the rooftop. Breakfast within the current COVID-19 restrictions was well organized and OK. We tried both restaurants the Bistrot and the Seafood Restaurant. Both excellent. Not really cheap but hey this is Le Zoute! Staff very friendly and helpful. Nothing,10
Great Breakfast and the location is fantastic. Best Skybar ever. Nice view and good beds. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ,10
Location Dated facilities and cleanliness borderline,5.8
It was good despite Covid. Construction work on the front side but all was ok N/a it was overall ok for a night and good value (covid time),7
 The pictures of the room seam one thing when i  booked the room but when i got on side it was very different from what i was expecting. The staff was very nice and friendly they even change the room for another one,5
Stayed in a junior suite. Very spacious and the bed was comfortable. Location is a bit of a walk to the central areas. Bar is not manned so you need to go out to reception to ask them to make you a drink.,9
Great parking facilities with EV charging and very smart and spacious suite. Foyer and communal areas were average.,7
Everything Not happy the amount I paid was not inclusive with breakfast,8.8
Room very nice excellent bed reception good. Dont take room 12 the floor above seems to have chairs being dragged around early in the morning this spoilt any chance of a peaceful sleep in.,5
 The floors in our room were dirty. Pillows are lumpy and uncomfortable. Bed is very hard not comfortable. Light system is unpractical. Hairdryer has one setting only that is extremely hot. ,5.4
Was clean and room very big modern.Receptionists speaks english fluently . Breakfast area was conservative and staff not too friendly. ,6.7
Helpful staff when I wanted to add late checkout to the booking. The room was a little aged. All of the electrical fittings were yellowed from age gave the place a bit of a cheap feel.. plus a loud hum from the electrical source when the halogen lights were on.,7.5
Comfortable room great location and a low price. People were very friendly. Breakfast was basic and could have a bit more variety. Elevator doors close extremely fast.,7.9
Location is excellent. The room is very clean. It was strange ticking sound in radiator an evening. Shower was difficult to get working. There is no carpet and they do not give slippers and bathrobe. I advise to take your own slippers if you do not want to walk on the floor by barefoot after shower.The design of room is bit clinical but in general it was not disturbing for staying during weekend. ,7
The breakfast far surpassed expectations with Covid restrictions. Room was large and spacious. ,9
Liked the firm bed kettle was provided mugs wine glasses fridge. Enjoyed access to the roof top balcony from my room (6th floor). The on-site restaurant serves delicious food (I was there for dinner).  It was great to have 2 types of eggs for breakfast and a variety of cold cuts and cheeses. I didnt find it too bad but my room was next to the elevator shaft which made noise at every hour day and night - that particular room location could be a problem for sensitive sleepers.,9.6
Very spacious room. Ours even had a balcony which was quite large and offered some good views. Friendly staff. While they dont have onsite parking the public garage is very close by. Reasonable breakfast. Very very dark room when first coming in at night. It took us a minute for our eyes to adjust so we could find where the other lamps were. We ended up leaving a light on while gone. Breakfast was a bit of a zoo. While we didnt have to wait there was a line a dozen people deep when we left.,8.8
Great location and friendly staff. Unfortunately doesnt make up for lying awake every night! This was the most unconfortable bed i have ever had. The matress was so old and worn out the springs were sticking in your back at night. Also lots of noise. The walls are very thin and you can hear your neighbors talking walking and making noises. Couldnt wait for our stay to be over.,5.8
It was ok but could be improved to match the 4 star rating.  Outdoor entrance and lobby interior appears kind  gloomyand  on the  dark side. Furniture has seen better days..  a more lively ristailing would help Interior looks,7
Location staff in general. Have been before hence the reason to come back.  Bar not open at lunch time. No food available at lunch time. Excuse given its a holiday here!!!My view is you are a hotel we come here for a break or holiday. ,7.1
The staff. No toilet brush in room. No extracter fan in bathroom.,8
The hotel is very central and convenient in a nice part of Antwerp. The room was generous the bathroom roomy. There was lots of choice for breakfast. The toilet was small no extraction fan.,8.8
sleeping room really street really quiet during the night. Unfortunatelly the air conditioning is old and noisy. Location is perfect quiet central near museims and good restaurants. The meir was about 5 min. per feet.,7.9
The location could not have been better and the staff were fantastic. The hotel needs updating as the decor was fairly dated and small details need a touch-up.,8
Good bed good breakfast good location nice room. nice bathroom! ,7.9
Great breakfast! The fact that the restaurant is closed on a Friday night and that parking is 18euro per night for a location that is most definitely not the center of Brussels,7.5
NATO HQ and Airport vicinity! To much importance that the place asumes without nothing in exchange!,7.5
The rooms are well insulated so no noise from aircraft taking off.  Rooms are basic but beds are comfortable aircon and heating works well. Main plus point are the staff they go out of their way to be helpful.  Arrived very late one night and although the restaurant was already closed they very kindly agreed to make me a sandwich and even brought it up to my room for me.  Thank you. The rooms could do with updating particularly the bathrooms.  A walk-in shower would be nice.,8
For a  hotel which boasts of a restaurant and bar when we requested for ice were asked to come down n get it. When we went to collect we were told no.ice. that was pretty disappointing. Better information and definitely better fruit n breakfast spread,6.3
Breakfast was good counter staff were also very well briefed. The restaurant menu was quite limited. Prices were average. Due to the fact that it is in an industrial park there is limited selection of other restaurants.,8
Staff at reception and breakfast/ diner very friendly and competent relaxing atmosphere . Room was ok all we needed was there . I missed the possibility to have a snack or light meal during lunchtime in the hotel but the friendly lady at the reception could order something if we were interested and in a 2 min. walking distance there was possibility to eat or buy a snack.,7.5
Clean comfortable close to the airport nice breakfast buffet good WiFi connection parking easy to get find and get to ,9.6
10 min drive from the airpory with free shuttlebus ,7.9
Comfortable beds quiet and efficient air-conditioning friendly and helpful staff. Restaurant was closed all week for the holidays.  Shower bracket incorrectly fitted (room 419) meaning you had to hold it (inconvenient when youre washing your hair).  Terrible noise from slamming room doors (the soft close function had been disabled).,7.5
Friendly helpful staff.  Comfortable beds good air-conditioning good TV with wide range of channels.  Complementary water in fridge and hot drink making facilities. Bathrooms need updating.  Narrow bath with shower curtain rather than walk-in shower.  Doors slamming late at night and early in the morning.  Infrequent shuttle service in the morning and over-filled at peak times (07:50am).,8
Responsive staff. Relocated to new room after issue. Location little far from Brussels vs the price if room,7.1
Good location for those traveling by plane and need to have quick access to the airport. The hotel has a free shuttle service to the airport. ,7.5
 There was a machine making noise above my head. I Had no idea they were renovating. I got another room after I complained.,7.1
Great location didnt feel like a hostel as it was fairly quiet.  The room needs painting. Its covered with splat marks from people squashing mosquitos.,6.7
I did not like anything about this hotel! I didnt like the curt staff. I didnt like that the restaurant was NOT open when it was supposed to. I did not like that the room was cold and the heater did not work. I did not like that they said they would not credit back my card if I checked-out.,1
Extra location normal breakfast. It was cold in the hotel. The room temperature could not be raised. Even the reception staff had runny nose due to the low inside temperature. The rooms should be repainted. The bathroom requires complete renovation. Carpets are dirty and old.,1
Friendly and efficient staff.  Comfortable rooms with large television and fast wifi.  Shuttle bus direct to the airport.  Good restaurant. Bathrooms could do with updating.  Limited menu selection when staying regularly.  Shuttle bus is in-frequent.,8.3
 The rooms are a little on the small side.  The set of TV channels was pretty limited and only at certain times.,7.9
Bfast had big choice and was clearly marked for alergens. New modern sound tight windows so no airline noise. Big new tv kettle and coffee machine. Room was very worn out countless stains on horrible carpet (in such busy airport hotel why solid floor easy to wash only by the door?) stains on the walls and chair hole in another chair. Bathroom very tired black stains between tiles although it looked clean and tidy. Very clean bed sheets but found hair. Lots of noise all night long from the corridor.,5.8
Friendly staff and perfect location to go to the airport ,8
Staff were checking in people before me for too long ,7.5
Great breakfast wonderful view strategic location Steady light noise from the ventilation system in the night,8
It was ok Building site due to work going on around adjacent hotels mini bus broken in to outside the hotel and high value property stolen ,6.3
Perfect location. Great rooms. Nice staff. Thanks for everything ,10
Nothing They ask me to pay for a second time!,5.8
Breakfast Small room building under construction.  Breakfast is the best thing about this hotel there were so many viriaties of nuts raisons freshly squeezed orange juice and much more however there seems to be a problem with fruit flies they were everywhere in the buffet area even on food.  I think this issue should be taken seriously as its very unhygienic.  Hotel is clean.We found it hard to move around in the room due to its size.  It lacks lighting no light above the mirror in the room. We stayed there one night and moved to another hotel near the station as we were leaving early the other hotel was much cheaper but room was bigger well lit and beautiful.  So very disappointed to have paid so much money for thon hotel.,5.4
I liked: 1.  the Reception staff Ridouane. He was  very friendly and welcoming. 2. Those who cleaned the room 2211 The billing: I checked out in the morning and I was in a hurry to read the details of my receipt. While at the train station I accessed my receipt and realised I was billed for city taxi twice which I never used  breakfast was billed twice yet I had indicated I was to have breakfast once. Otherwise the rest looked ok.,10
Very friendly staff very good breakfast fast check out good Location (City Center public transport). ,9.6
Very good hotel. close to Gare de Nord: 10 min walking. Near metro station and not fare away from City centre. Clean. Very expensive breakfast but you can find good food in the lobby of the hotel (Grab and go). Nothing,9.6
The breakfest was really exceptional so many varieties of hight quality food and drinks. Nice atmosphere. Staff tried to be helpfull. The hotel is close to the public transportation stations - metro bus even railwaystation. The equipment of the room did not fully correspond to the description. Especially  accessories in the bathroom corresponded more for 2star hotel. The towels no bathfoam only one shower gel in a big flask... The fasade  and surrounding of the hotel was under reconstrution.,7
 I waited 30 minutes the elevator in the morning of Jan 25. This the 2nd time that that inconvenience happens in this hotel,6.7
excellent breakfast very large hotel with a homely feel very helpful staff and central location very clean and comfortable room ,10
 The cleaners left our door unlocked and unattended twice with our valuables inside!,4.6
The City centre The taps in the bathroom and  the shower didnt work as well as they shoild,10
Excellent breakfast Sauna could have been open longer.,8
Location Small rooms old elevators and noise from other rooms.,7
Great location very comfortable No option to adjust aircon in the room,10
 The bar staff were slow and not very friendly,8.8
the staff is courteous and efficient the superior room is spacious but the use of the space is awkward very little space for your clothes int the bathroom the rack for towels is just above the shelve so they cannot be properly hanged you get a dressing gown but there nowhere hooks to hang them you need to lie down on the floor to use the safe as it is just at that level plugs are at locations useless for your computer use unless the cables become traps when you walk. The choice of colors is cold (grey and green) and the bathroom materials on the cheap side.  If you like to take part in the life on the street rejoice the quality of the insulation of the building allows you to enjoy the noise of the street works during the day and the sirens of police/ambulances during all night,5.8
 Staff for front disk not polite he raised his voice on my wife and me and did not respect us.,3.8
Its walking distance from the city centerHave breakfast at the place at the corner its awesome  After booking there was an email offering extra upgrades to the room but when we arrived apparently this wasnt an option,7.1
 The breakfast was too expensive. There should have been more than one option of breakfast offer.,6
The staff were friendly and supportive. The rooms were clean.  The price is a bit hiked up. My room was next to the on-going construction site and therefore was sometimes noisy. The good thing the noise was restricted to non-sleeping hours. ,9.6
 Wake up at 7.30 with the crazy noise of the reconstruction. Ask the reception and the answers :-you really hear that they work on the 3 rd floor-we can not control them another company-we can not inform you we dont know when they startThe receptionist on July 16 th 9 am. and his college behind the desk..both of them are very impolite and couldnt understand that they are working at a hotel and clients are Guests.dont know the simple word we are sorry. ,2.5
The staff lounge and bar area is comfortable and inviting. Room is decent comfortable bed and pillows adequate bathroom. There are huge works going on next door the noise started at 7:15 AM. They provide earplugs for one person which is a nice gesture but if you book a twin room they should provide two sets of earplugs.,7.9
 Impersonal service AC was not proper. Would have appreciated some guidance,5.4
Great location (about 5 min from train station 2 min from metro station) close to city center. Wonderful breakfast comfortable bed.  ,10
 Registration not clod  i note told  housekeeping already but them dont to improve a problem ,6.7
Optimum location! 10 minutes walking from brussels north station 10 minutes walking to grand plce and surrounding area and right in front of the shopping street. Room was super clean and bed was comfy. Theres a nespresso machine in the room. Ear plugs are provided in the room due to the construction work surrounding the hotel.  Nothing. It was perfect.,10
Ideal location for my work project. Ideal location - walking distance to the Grand Place. Major Metro stations within 100 mts. Complimentary water in the rooms. Very small and slow elevators.,7.9
StaffLocation View of BrusselsEquipement ,8.8
Staff are all very nice speak good English. David is very friendly answered all our queries make sure our stay are enjoyable. He suggested us to visit Bruges where the place leave the most memorable and enjoyable stay in Belgium. Hotel is in good size and comfortable. Nearby building were under construction and blocked the name of hotel had little difficulty in finding the hotel at the beginning perfect otherwise. They have a great selection of breakfast! Highly recommend!  ,9.6
 The elevators were terrible. I waited for more than 15 minutes! Towels were more 1 star then anything else. Construction work was a problem (sound vibration) in the morning.,6.3
Comfortable bed. Nice touches like Thursday specials Monday shoeshine.. Going downstairs to reception. Squeezy soaps (hate them).  Rather dark in the room.,8
Location and wifi were good. Dark hallways with lights that would just go off and you couldnt see as you tried to find your room.  32 Euro breakfast per person.  Building under construction.  Tiny small elevators.  No dinner / restaurant in hotel.  Facilities such as sauna did not work with my room key.,6.7
Good breakfast good bed reasonable internet connection Very thin walls and door noise from corridor. There were also construction work very close but that was noisy only day time so that was not an issue.,7.9
 There was construction all around the hotel and booking.com did not mention that which I found very decieving. After I complained to booking.com I received a call from a very polite young man who said that they contacted the hotel and that the hotel will be in touch with me. Of course the hotel did not get in touch with me and the staff had no idea what I was talking about and couldnt care less.  At the check in I had to change the room 2 times because the rooms were not clean or had a defekt.,4.2
The atmosphere. Construction work outside,9
 We stayed in a family room. The sofa bed was ok only for young kids very narrow and too thin matress. The toilet equipped with WC and sink without mirror was really bad smelling impossible to use it. On Sunday for a long time there were no scrumbled eggs for breakfast one of the coffee machine was out of order lumpy waffles.,4
The room and staff. The price for breakfast was to expensive for us so we had to go out. And some staff members couldnt speak english but only French which made it difficult for us.,8.8
The layout of the room and the location The smell in the hallway of the 9th floor. The noise of construction in the morning.,5.8
The stay in the hotel was really a very nice experience. The staff was very polite. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 AM and although the time for check-in is scheduled for 2 PM the receptionist Radovane was so polite to give us a room. Great facilities and super great location. Ill choose this hotel again when I visit Brussels in the future. ,10
Spacious reception area  Overall decor Smell of food in my room 1001 Noisy room 1001 - ear plugs left on the side table arent a solution!,6.7
Was a very good stay. The breakfast was absolutly amazing. ,9.2
I like this chain of hotels. Really good. There was really variety of food for the breakfast however scrambled eggs bacon and sausages I took were not a surplus.,9
Quite close to the citys attractions. The breakfast was real good. Beds were comfortable. The bathroom could be cleaner. Car park was very expensive.,8.8
Clean room tele has english channels Nice bed. A bit noisy due to the construction work outside.  Pillows can be softer.,7.1
Everything was amazing the location is exactly in the center of Brussels friendly staff and very good amenities Excellent value for money will book again when I return to Brussels  ,10
 Thon Hotel changed a charge on my credit card DAYS before I checked out!!! Im very disappointed with that and would never stay there again,2.5
Clean easily navigated and good atmosphere  with good staff. Bar is nice and the hotel is situated in a great area to get into the centre. All around a really enjoyable hotel Booked to pay on arrival through booking and a charge of ¬£25 per night as a deposit extra to secure the booking that wasnt mentioned upon first booking,7.5
area close to the city centre the room was very cold tried to put the air conditioning higher but without success,6.3
A lot but the most one is the location that is so strategic the bathroom is quite big and very clean also i love the view from my room Nothing,10
The location was ok 20 euros extra for the city view was a waste of money since the hotel doesnt really face the city centre.. The part that should overlook the city is literally being built so the whole building is under construction Not to mention that the hair dryer was useless. ,5.8
Great hotel in good location. Good facilities and clean room. Buildings around having alot of construction work so come 7am its very loud!!  We also requested an early check in that was accepted  before hand but when we arrived they couldnt accommodate,6.3
Perfect location ! Aircon in our room could be looked at. Wasnt very strong.,8.3
Overall it is a nice and comfortable hotel No electric sockets near the bed,8.8
Location and cleanliness Room was quoted at $178 got there and $227 gets taken from my card no explanation as to why staff member said there was a block of $50 to be taken and returned to me 3 days later still no $50 back if not back by tomorrow will be contacting the hotel directly  very very poor,6.3
breakfast and localization few sockets in the room,9.6
Quite elaborate and the food was well done. The variety was excellent. The juice was fresh and the chocolate was a bonus The bed left little passage on ether side. Towels in bathroom were old the shower was a bit squeezed in the bath tap. The outside view was block by on-going construction. The metro underground was sometime causing distraction.,7.1
 The bathroom(toilet) was not clean enough. There was a yellow line on the back of the toilet bowl.,7.5
Location was acceptable close to train station an a 10 min walk into centre. Breakfast over priced with the initial booking reduced to half price at the hotel desk however this was still overpriced at $16 per head.,5.8
Very friendly staff. Sauna broken. Long wait at check-in.,6.3
The proximity to the city centre the public transport and the gard du midi. Its ease to check in and out. The view from the sauna (apart from the huge cranes). The Nespresso machine free water and the cleanliness of the room. Plus the TV had a few English channels which passed the evening away before bed.  That the entire building and its surroundings werent finished and the building work started at 7am (if not earlier). The ice machine didnt work. Two of the four lifts didnt work. The fitness floor was dire and the spa was much to be desired. The front of the hotel is covered in scaffolding so you cant see the building making it easy to walk by.,5.8
Surrounding Environment very good. None,8.3
Sauna was so nice and good . The hotel location was perfect .The breakfast was good . I wish if there was a swimming pool also .,9.2
Hotel is very nice. Grocery store next door. Hotel has gym and sauna plus a games rooms. Is within walking distance to noor train station Does not have a restaurant to as advertised but has a bar and a grab and go station. Also area is not very safe location their are loads of gypsy and pick pocketers. Not many food place. I would recommend staying in burgge,9.2
1. Great location2. Clean3. Friendly staff4. Meet expectations 1. The door of toilet was broken and even though I informed the staff no one came to fix it.2. The AC was broken,7.9
very clean very convenient location staff are super nice ,9.2
The hotel is in a walking distance from the Brussel Noord railway station. My room had a bath tub which was great. I opted for no breakfast because I was limited in my budget (a business trip) so I cannot comment on this. I was slightly surprised that there were no free toiletries and no electric kettle (as promissed in the confirmation mail) and the room was probably smaller than the indicated 19 m2. Luckily I was the only guest in this double-bed room.,7.1
Everything was decently clean in the room but hallways and reception could be improved. The room was tiny for the price it was hard to navigate because the table was too close to the bed and it was in the way. Tea machine didnt work it got stuck and didnt extract anything. WiFi was slow. For the price they charge this shouldnt happen.,5
Excellent location that close to a busy shopping street. High floor has good city view. The sofa bed is really disappointed. Very thin mattress and super noisy bed frame that kept waking me up whole night!,8
A large modern hotel with the usual selection of facilities. We only stayed for one night as a break of journey having arrived late in the evening on the Eurostar from London. However the hotel was clean and comfortable and very conveniently located adjacent to Rogier metro station which gives good connections to Brussels Midi station and the rest of the city centre. ,9.2
very nice set up big rooms clean.. waited for breakfast over 40mins,9
its good hotel I  could not sleep because of the sound of construction workers,8.3
fitness room equipment was not fully functional ,7.5
Proximity to Metro Very noisy plumbing and buildings work and checkout staff not attentive.,6.3
The hotel is superbly situated and looks like it was recently renovated. The room was big and the bed was comfortable.The staff were helpful. There was a cool way of mirroring your telephone/tablet to the TV which is handy. The wifi was excellent. The equipment is a hit and miss. I had a Nespresso coffee maker which is OK but it didnt work 100% well. There were no toiletries just a basic squeeze thing for shower gel in the shower. There were no information sheets in the room (e.g. I wanted to know the gym opening times but there was no information around). And seriously in the 21st century and at this price range youre supposed to have electrical sockets (if not USB plugs directly) near the bedroom. The socket situation wasnt good at all.,7.1
It near alot of shopping malls which is just a walking distance from the hotel. In addition the breakfast is excellent with rooms that are spacious. The flexibility of extending checking out hours was highly appreciated during last trip Next time offer complementary rates considering that am a regular customer at Thon. The rooms have been supplied  with compressors which are suitable for making coffee and not when one wants to make tea. Consider providing a kettle in each room.,7.5
Perfect accommodation in the city center. Spacious and very well equipped apartment with balcony. You feel like at home but in Busel. The reception is at a nearby hotel where you will be asked to pay a $ 100 Euro deposit during check-in which was returned after check-out. Everything works very well and reliably. I warmly recommend. ,10
Very nicely furnished living room with a bedroom. Modern kitchen with all the necessary amenities. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff.  The hotel where keys are picked up has a 24-hour reception and is very close to apartment. Pleasant surroundings (close to shops restaurants). Old bathroom and toilet pretty ruined and not very clean. I was wondering when the hair dryer would break down because it was quite old and damaged.  The smell in the toilet was terrible they could invest in some cleaning products. The surprise was also a deposit of 100 Euros I had not found this information before on the website but there was no problem with returning the money at check-out.,8.3
Very nice and convenient appartment I think the price could be a bit lower having in mind it does not include breakfast,7.1
Excellent apartment had all what I needed Nothing to say here,10
Great location optimal space in the apartment  ,8.8
It was very clean and modern and everything I needed was there 1. The address was given as 91-93 Avenue Louise. You check in there but the apartment is several hundred metres away at 9 Rue Florence. Not helpful with a suitcase rain etc especially if your taxi has left!2. The mezzanine arrangement is a horror - suitcase up those hazardous tiny stairs! 3. Far too expensive at $200 a night,5.5
The location is perfect. The bathroom is old and shabby. The apartment has no soul the decoration is poor. I didnt like staying there luckily they gave me a room in the hotel. The staff was helpful and friendly to handle the case.,5.4
 An update to room needed.  Extremely old.  Extremely hot. Loud to sleep if window left open otherwise very hot.,7.9
 We arrived very late in evening and we did not exchange money. Surprising for me was that I had to pay for stay immediately. Of course I paid by card but I have had cash for that (in Euro).,7.1
Nice and spacious single rooms great view from 15th floor. We did not use air conditioning but there was some in comfort rooms. Good bathroom. Well organised hotel with great staff at reception. All English speaking quick check in and out registration for foreigners in minutes perfect transport from and to airport (reasonable charge). Good breakfast great and not expensive dinner in restaurant even late in the evening. Metro to center nearby. Everything perfect. ,10
Clean and comfortable room with an awesome view friendly and attentive staff and a really good location. There are fridge wi-fi and TV so everything for your comfortable stays and relaxes. ,9
There is central shop beside the hotel where you can exchange and buy something and also metro station is next to door. Breakfast was eatable. Seems like the hotel itself and management sticker in the Soviet era and not developed themself.,3.3
Very close to subway. Big hotel well organized. Heaters in bathroom were working all the time despite the temperature outside was awfully high. Room was hot like hell.,6.7
 No hot water. And staff does not care for it.,4
clean reasonable sized roomcomfortable bed expensive but secure parking A lot of noise all night from the lift mechanism,6.3
The room was clean e the position is near the station and 10 minutes by foot from the center. The staff was really bad they told us the first day that we can had the breakfast (but didnt mean to pay for it or how much) and the last day they ask to pay for it (also too much 10$ per person each day). It was very incorrect! They ruin our trip! Absolutely not to come back to! ,5.4
It is very nice people very kind and helpful..  Didnt have a place to open my lagguage because of small rooms,8.3
Nice Hotel close to the centre. The room was clean and had a good bed. Due to Covid-19 breakfest was not possible,7
Small hotel looks old better pictured than in real life. We stayed 1 night. For 1-2 nights this hotel is great or if you are on a tight budget. If you are going on vacation you better choose a more comfortable hotel. We liked everything but it is clear that the hotel is already tired. In any case we were completely satisfied. The location is great and the staff are very friendly. The hotel is quiet you cant hear the neighbors. It can be seen that the hotel is not new it does not affect the comfort but still. The ponds are very small and uncomfortable.,7
The hotel has nice location near  all attractions and Central Station room is basic but very clean staff  is very helpful ,9.6
Located in a quiet street within walking distance of Antwerp Central Station and easily found. ,8.8
Although there was some problem with the conditioner in my first room the staff help us to change the room. ,7
The location is fine. Breakfast was OK. We couldnt figure out how to turn off the heater/air conditioner completely during the night which would have been nice because the sound was bothering us.,7.9
Locationnice peronal parking (did not get breakfast) god size Floor in room not clean no fridge a boring room,6
the bathroom was nice and clean and the hotel was very central the bed is very uncomfortable and the rooms are not soundproof thus you can hear everything happening outside in the corridor. unfortuantely it affected my sleep a lot,6
The location is very good. 10 minutes walk to Antwerp Central station Nothing to mention,8.3
 Air conditioning wasnt working and it was cold,7
Very well positioned. It is in the center near the shopping centers and the train station. Very friendly and welcoming staff! We recommend with warmth! ,10
Great central location for sight seeing and near the Antwerp Centraal train station Metro shops supermarkets restaurants and bus stops. Decent sized room. Comfortable bed. Good TV and stations including BBC. Plenty of storage. Good shower room. Good breakfast (NB I had to pay 10 euros each time). The duvet was rather too small and I needed more pillows & cushions. No complimentary coffee & tea. No iron in room.,9.6
Good price. Decent breakfast. Good location. ,7.9
Good price/QAvailability staff It takes some time to get warm water. Maybe you can inform guests about this.,8
The hotel is really close to the central station and the Meir Also the staff is really nice You can hear everything that is happening in other rooms when they are watching TV or talking and other clients were really noisy starting from 6 am (Not the hotels fault obviously) The room is not 100% clean but its still okay,7.9
The staff was so nice and friendly. The room was cleaned everyday. The towels were changed too. WiFi work good. The room was so tiny but I know it so I can complain.,7.1
The location was perfect: near everything and is surrounded by kosher restaurants. The staff was friendly and available 24/7 and the accommodations were better than we expected. There was no view: outside the window is concrete.,8.8
Hotel was overpriced for the standard and location at $159. Think that the owners saw the opportunity to rip people off with poor value because other hotels were at capacity. The area where it is located is not great back streets near the train station. proximity to station - 10 mins walk - Hampton Hotel is much nearer the station and quite possibly cheaper it wasnt listed on Booking.com,4
The location was very accessible & convenient - 5 mins walk to Antwerp Central station and 10 mins away from the main shopping district. Many restaurant choices around the area. There was no heating in my room. There was an A/C unit but no remote control so the room was very cold at night. Unfortunately during my stay the guests opposite my room were playing music (loud enough I could hear) and arguing loudly for close to 30mins.,6
 cleanliness of bed was not good. Pillows n quilts quality is below average and dirty as well.,4.2
Kamer was prima locatie in de stad tov station Nies,7.1
Quiet room that was very clean The bed and especially the mattress were terrible.,7.5
Good position next to railway station and subway. Easy check-in/out. Room (1st floor) not very soundproof overlooking the back of an Indian restaurant. Only a portable stowe for heating. The shower was missing some pieces.,6
Great value for money friendly staff easy underground parking so close to everything in Antwerp  Nothing not to like,8
Only the location. Poor maintenance of facilities in the bedroom - much of the furniture/doors are pretty beaten up poorly clean - lots of dust in the floor yellow-ish sheets with a few hairs. avoid if not in a budget/no other option. Struggles as a 3 star hotel.,5.8
Close to the railway and del ray chocolate ,7.5
Comfortable beds possibility of paid parking.  The receptionist took a copy of my ID without asking he could not help with information on parking on the street.Water in the bathroom was almost cold tv was not working air condition did not have a remote so it was not possible to adjust it.Rather expensive. ,6
Rooms were clean and tidy. Sufficient for a few days stay. Heater wasnt great. Tv wasnt working.,7.9
Location was great. Staff were very nice and helpful. ,10
For the price we payed the room was quite basic we were expecting a higher standard. Everything quite simple but clean and ok for one night. The area was nothing special but for us it was important to stay not far from the bus and train station and for this the location was perfect. The breakfast was ok and we could leave our luggage in the hotel after check-out. Rooms very simple not very comfortable but functional lack of decoration or any additional details. The view from the room was not very nice an ugly office building or something like this.,7.1
Hotel was super cross to the train station and the main shopping street- however as he city is quite small it was pretty easy to walk anywhere.  The rooms are basic similar to a travel lodge in the UK. Everything is clean and bed was comfy. Room was a little small- we both had quite big bags and was difficult to manage when in the room!,7.5
Very hospitable personell. Quiet yet central location. Nice size on the room. OK breakfast. ,8
Ideal location for the train station only a max 5 minute walk. Staff were pleasant and professional. Clearly dated but functional. Had to change rooms as the shower was broken along with the air conditioning and hair dryer. Shower pressure in new room was awful but at least it worked.Avoid on weekends as it seems popular with stag weekends and the walls are paper thin. Garner what information you need from that statement.Probably wouldnt stay here again but if everywhere else in this budget is sold out then it will do in a pinch.,6.3
No fruit at the sufficient breakfast unfortunately ,7.5
The location is amazing and its calm. The night receptionist obviously doest like his job.,6.7
Location to city centre  It could have been better   There was no bathing gel and things looked old in the hotel,7.9
Nice room it very clean and quiet. The breakfast was very good and the stuff was friendly. So everything a hotel needs:D It wasnt possible to turn off the air condition. A very little negative part about the breakfast were the scrambled eggs which didnt taste quite fresh but were still eatable.,9
City center location. Smell in the room. Window curtains dont close the whole window. Expensive and inconvenient  parking. Poor breakfast.,3.8
Excellent hotel located to all shops and amenities. Short walking distance to Central Station. Nil,8
As the main property seemed to be full we were moved around the corner and down the street just a short way and put up in an apartment.  This was fine - a large accommodation with privacy. My preference would have been to stay in the main property given how attractive the photos showed the rooms to be but I suppose that wasnt on.  The substituted accommodations were acceptable though despite being in need of a bit of polishing.,7.5
Nice staff and although there were things that could have been better it more or less represented value for money Beds were soft and matesses slipped off the bed base. Also I had a lumpy pillow but in fairness this was replaced as soon as I notified the staff. Overall the appearance of the room was a bit shabby but it was at the end of the day a budget hotel.,7.5
The location of the hotel is great just minutes away from Central Station close to everything. The staff was nice and friendly easy check-in and check-out. The room was next to the elevator and it was pretty noisy every time someone used it (a lot of banging noises old elevator). No hairdryer. Rooms could be cleaner.,6.7
Super friendly personnel with a lot of helpful tips and recommendations! ,8.8
Location near Anwertpen Central train station Evening: .. very nasty staff Dirty roomDirty floor7 mosquitoes Bed linen used The photos shown on booking.com do not correspond to reality,3.8
Clean and close to the city Heater is not on so its very cold at night,8
Very good place to stay during a city trip quiet and clean room good breakfast with perfect coffee! ,8.8
Staff were nice We paid $184.00euros for one night. So we expected a nice room for that price.The room was shabby.  There was a noisy clanging noise all night. I think it was the elevator.,5.8
Luggage can be kept after check out Smelly bathroom. TV channels were not working.,4.6
Well located and decent breakfast Staff manager rooms broken dirtyness thieves,1
Very nice location free coffee everything was great. ,10
Location is right in the street of diamond shops. Close to central station and restaurants etc. Very convenient. ,10
The location was great. Just a few minutes walk from the station. The staff wasnt super helpful. It was like a self-service style. Also when I asked one of the employees to fix the AC in my room he was very reluctant and offensive.,7.1
 We would have liked to have a kettle in the room to have some coffee and tea.,7.5
The hotel is clean and new. The bathroom was really comfortable and super clean. Also the location is perfect very near to many restaurants.  The room and bathroom were tiny but clean and modern. The fisrt room that we were offered was in the basement without natural light humidity and small. After our disappointment the manager change us to a room in the 2on floor with a better light and maybe bigger. ,7.5
The main value is the position close to the city centre and the central station. All the remaining services are pretty basic. Large room and bed. I cannot think of anything else positive but the price. The cleanliness and level of maintenance of the room and the bathroom was just passable. I got a room at ground floor with very poor lighting and the window facing directly on the courtyard providing basically no privacy. Little space for clothes and luggage.,5
NothING special 1000 out thousands Hotel is simple nothing special and dark area,5.8
Location and staff The room was very moistened and we had to change a room because the first ons was smelly,5.4
 Might have just been unlucky myself but the right shower handle was broken so very little and only cold water. Due to timing couldnt ask to fix it or change room that same morning (when I tried to shower). There was no receptionist in the morning to check out so I just left the key on the desk as I needed to leave in a hurry. ,6
The hotel is located in the city centre and the central station is just a 5 minute walk. The employee at the desk was friendly. The shower did not have hot water unless you turned it on for 10 minutes. The employee told us this was because the hotel was almost empty.We booked a room with a double bed (2 person) but got 2 single bed with a double mattress on top and two single bed covers. Not really romantic.We woke up a few time at night because of staff shouting and slamming doors.We had to pay an additional fee of 5 euros for city tax which we were not aware of. ,6
Close to main train station and shops clean rooms quiet Feather pillows with no spares which didnt suit our personal preference,8.3
Excellent location helpful staff very dog-friendly Needs a/c in the bedroom. Also there were lots of mosquitoes,8
Pretty much everything- staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel and the room were clean tidy and comfortable And we enjoyed a drink in the bar and an early breakfast. Very good value for money. If we can find a Tulip Hotel near where we want to go next time we travel we shall book our stay there. Only a small niggle: although we went down to breakfast at about 07.30 there really wasnt much left to eat - just as well we were in a hurry to get on the road..,10
Location room size parking staff Noise from the highway with windows open.,9
The Locations is good.Good breakfast in COVID timeGood staff Very small room for a twin bed room.Poor refilling of tea toilet paper.Horrible orange juice from machine.,6
Parking space outside the hotel When I arrived to check in nobody was there I had to wait 10 min to be attended after i rang the bell..Elevator was not working and it has been broken for 6 weeks ! Stairs to the rooms dirty area outside hotel needs refurbishing Soap dispensers in the bathroom empty although I mentioned it after the first night.,4.6
The staff were polite and proffesional. The breakfast could be more fresh and should cater better to vegans. The fruit wasnt fresh and the eggs were very soggy. In terms of the comfort for the bed the pillows are terrible. Very thin and not much support. Also the bed is quite sinky so doesnt support your back well if you have pain. ,7
Very friendly and helpful staff good location for travel through Europe. Dog friendly Bed was a bit hard,9
Clean room - good breakfast Close to the motorway - some background noise even with closed windows,6.7
Location and parking People on the terrace at 2.30 am till 4.30 am. With open window this was noisy and smoke bothered us.,7
Staff was really friendly. The lady that checked us in was accommodating and professional. ,9
The overall stay was good. Had a small problem with the room but was sorted straight away when they could not solve the problem by giving me another room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was not operating but they had a small takeaway menu that was ok.The room was comfortable and clean.  ,8

.Very clean  functional and modern. Young friendly staff. Limited range of food but  all excellent. Great value for money. Good location  for city and aiport ,9.5
In the current climate everything was good. The staff were great friendly  and very helpful. The room was large and very clean. Even though the restaurant was closed they produced a small takeaway menu and it was good  served on plates with cutlery just like you would in the restaurant.  ,8
Rooms were quite spacious and were clean. Easy parking. Food in the restaurant was nice (once we got the correct orders!) Unfortunately it was very hot when we there- there was no air conditioning or fan in the room which made the room unbearably hot we had to leave the window open which unfortunately still didnt solve the problem and was very noisy with the road running behind and being eaten by mosquitoes - this is the reason for my low score as it just made for an unenjoyable night there,5.8
Ok in these strange times Crusty rolls very,9
 It was expensive for this hotel. And I found insects on the floor. No Aircon.,8
Good location for onward travel not far from motorway. Has a decent bar and food available. There is also a good supermarket about 5 minute walk away. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Very basic but all I expected and needed. Shower soap holder was empty. Poor attention to detail.,8
The decoration of the bed and the painting on the wall. It was perfect.,9
 breakfast is expensive for the way it is served,8
The staff was helpfull and they spoke good english. The room was as expected nothing more and nothing less we had a great stay. You need to either walk 4-5 km to get to the central city or you can take the tram that is conveniently close.,10
Receptionist were very professional and polite. No air conditioning the phone did not work and the single beds were better suited for children not adults.I paid $9 for a litre bottle of water!!,1
Location close to the freeway but that was beneficial for me. Comfortable bed A small selection will last for breakfast. No shower gel. Room chilled out and needed to warm up quickly. The TV did not work,7
Very easy check in and out. Staff were pleasant and spoke good English. Rooms were dirty with visible damage. Unpleasant smell in corridors.,5
Very helpful staff and great value for money. Free parking. Nothing,8
Friendly and professional staff always ready to help. Clean and quiet bedroom. Well-connected location especially when traveling by car. Excellent breakfast (fresh orange juice!). As mentioned super breakfast but we missed some chocolate spread. Scrambled eggs and although the croissants were delicious a bit more choice of pastries would also have been nice particularly on a Sunday -),9.6
Very rude staff at the reception. No consideration for the family nor customer service experience. Instead of being sorry about room that were not in the block for the family and also single bed instead if king size bed. We were told this is what we have take it or leave it since reservation is with Booking.com. Furthermore we we asked for the manager they indicated that we have to come back on Monday. Very disappointing experience! The staff at the reception and their unfriendly attitude.,3.8
The property was extremely clean and in a good location. Parking was free which was great ! But the bed wasnt very big and it wasnt very comfortable. My husband didnt sleep well. The room wasnt very big either. The staff at reception was extremely unfriendly. The cleaning lady was very nice and polite though ! But unfriendly staff at reception/check in kind of spoiled it.Next time I will stay in an Ibis budget because its much better value for money.  See above,5
Modern clean hotel . Very friendly and helpful staff .  This week I am come here again . Thank you . nothing,9
I like the cozy room. The lift was dirty for all day and nobody cared.,6.7
Nice clean and silent. Parking for free in front of the house. Freindly staff. The bar was closed because corona -).,8
Really clean and nice hotel location very close to motorway but we couldnt hear it at all. As promised it was quiet. Easy to find. We didnt use the restaurant but it looked cosy. Comfortable beds and all what you need in a bathroom.  All was fine!,8
Nothing The custom they unfriendly and also u wait ours to receive a bil and they unpolite,1
Everything was good. Also the meal service was very good ,10
Everything was finegood locationnice staffclean rooms. The room should have a little fridgeon description says that the rooms are soundproofbut they arent.,7.9
Standard double room was good. Great shower. breakfast was awful,5
Easy access and parking Very small rooms not a working environment,5
Staffs were very friendly and helpful.The cleaning department cleaned the rooms each time we went out for sight seeings.And also kitchen staffs gave food fresh and hot.Good and quiet Location despite the motorway not far off. Nothing I can think of.Wished we had a bigger room for the whole family instead of using two rooms.,10
Clean room. Nice food. WiFi never worked in my room. Walking distance from the bus stop but needed to cross busy roads so not very pleasant walking especially there were many bikes not care about walking people at all.,5.8
Average hotel no positive or negative surprise. Friendly staff clean room. Free parking is almost unique in belgium so I gave 3 extra points for this. It saved us a lot of money. Bus stop near the hotel. Youre in the city within 15 minutes. If Im coming back to Antwerpen Ill book this hotel again. ,9
The free parking The elevator was not working and we had to lug the bags up narrow stairs. No a/c.,5.8
Clean. Near the festival. Friendly and helpful staff The steps were too thin and dangerous,7.5
Friendly staff nice rooms. Quite nice for a one night stay. ,8
Good location It was very hot in the room,7.5
Very close to historic city center comfortable clean ,8.3
An was a fantastic host and gave us tips inc a walking tour of Ghent which we enjoyed greatly.  The beds are comfortable and the room is modern.  Location is ideal for walking into the town centre.  Highly recommended ,10
New hotel. Its clean and close to the centre. ,9
Location is ok DONT GO TO HOTEL CATHEDRAL! Both the bathroom and room are really dirty! Please see the picture of our clean bathroom. Ive never seen something like this. For this price you could get a proper hotel instead of a really dirty room.,2.5
Excellent location and very nice and comfortable room! See you soon Many thanks  ,10
I used to stay here ( it had a different name) regularly when  I worked with a nearby company.  Last stayed over 5 years ago. Not much has changed in the rooms they are fine.  The check-in has limited open hours and there is no longer a bar and the original breakfast room is no longer used.  The late check-in procedure worked well did not try the breakfast. The restaurant next door is still good. Not as friendly as it used to be.,7.9
Basic but complete very acceptable all round great value Very warm kinda thin walls ,8.3
The parking is right in front of the hotel had no issues finding a perfect spot. The rooms are clean and so is the rest of the hotel The breakfast is poor. There are no hot dishes such as any kind of sausages or eggs or anything. Its just several kinds of salami cereals and drinks.,7.5
There was a small fridge and an AC unit in our room The fridge didnt cool anything The AC was unable to refresh the room after 3+ hours of working,7.9
Room and facilities as exactly advertised. Clean and neat though not newly built or modern. Good value for money. Easy check in and check out. Location was a bit remote from the main transport areas. To and fro transport will consume time if not driving a car. No restaurants or other amenities nearby.,7.9
the room is clean and the man in the reception so nice and helpful . there are a wedding in the same building of the hotel the music during all the night until 2 or 3 oclock in the morning we cant sleep never because of this and we were obliged to dont go in the morning to work . we pass a horrible night i am going to ask my money back. !!,5.8
Location geographique 8 Self check in during Covid 19 pandemic ,6
As previous years the staff was very kind. It is a good hotel next to the expo area in Brussels and perfect for the event we were attended. The carpets could be a bit cleaner. Anyhow nothing was out of order and we had a good time.,7
Room was very clean despite pets being allowed!„ÄÄBreakfast was also very satisfying. There are various tourist facilities nearby.„ÄÄRecommended! ,10
The hotel was not busy due to the corona virus situation. Breakfast was not available due to the reduced number of rooms occupied room has comfortable beds Very good value for money ,7
Clean nd spacious. just like a 3* hotel I loved it,10
 Mold in bathroom and room partly dirty bed linen Windows didnt close fully repair was requested but didnt happened,3
The room was very cozy and quiet .Tv refrigerator safe for keeping personal belongings .In the lounge downstairs you could eat snacks or drink a coffee. Only a handful of parking slots but you can find many free parking places in the surrounding streets.,9
A great salution for a short stay in Brussels.Well organised for late check-in - ers. Free street parking in the area. ,9.2
Atomium is just 20 mins walk from hotel . Express check-in is available which helps us in check-in at late night. It was difficult for connecting to public transport. Receptionists is not available during 10:00 am to 3:00 pm and after 8:00 pm in weekends and hence we couldnt get any help .,9
Comfortable. Entry and receiving room key after office hours was simple and convenient No airport shuttle that we knew of. Location from airport.Coffee machine failed to deliver after payment was made,6.7
Comfortable bed clean and tidy room extremely close to Brussels Expo A bit expensive for the word CHEAP (2 star) hotel,7
Confortable and clean No staff. No breakfast,7
 shower stopped and became cold after a short time and I found a long hair in the bed making me wondering if the bedsheet was changed before I arrive.,5.4
 No storage room no iron reception is open for a limited time.,6
Good location. The room was too warm and we couldnt control the temperature. Also there was no service to clean the room during our stay. ,8
The room was clean A lot of noise during the night which was very annoying for sleeping,7.1
20min walk to the metro 10min walk to the bus.You pass by the Atomium on the way to the Metro so we did it daily instead of using the bus. ,8
Vety clean and cosy the system of express check-in is amazing. Vety good email communication.  It was not very easy to reach it late at night.,9.2
Clean and big rooms reasonably priced easy check-in and out in Corona times free parking in front of the hotel/surroundings reasonable if you dont want to pay for the LEZ (driving permit) to the city center but want to visit Brussels by car walking distance to the tram (around 30-35 minutes to the city center) Everything was as expected,8
Spacious room and super comfortable bed the shower was also really good. It had a clothesline over the bath with was super handy. We never actually saw any staff due to a late check in but their efficient late check in system was super easy and quick The location we ended up having to walk extremely far. There is a bus but the driver drove past every stop before you could read what it was causing us to miss it. There wasnt any A/C so we had to sleep with the windows open which meant all the noise from the street kept us up.  Overall was a pretty decent stay and definitely would have liked to have been there longer,7.9
There was no air conditioning. The room was so hot we could not sleep with windows open.  Sweating whole night. ,6.7
Close to Expo center by walk in 10 minutes. Good wifi. The smell in the room the quite old furniture the clogged wc the level of the general cleaning quite low.,5
Comfty clean good wifi Good place close to the metro ,8
Quiet neighbourhood beautiful view quite close to the bus station and close to the Atomium I would say it was a 20 minutes walk away from the Atomium. The room was better than shown in the pictures and super clean. The bed was comfortable. We appreciated the express check-in service because we arrived late at night around 12 PM and we were able do to the check-in ourselves and go to our room. ,9.6
Nothing special but everything was ok It was very hot everywhere the soap/shampoo was missing. ,7.1
The bed was comfortable and it was cheap. It also has good transport links into the city. The toilet needs cleaning/replacing. The flush function falls off the wall.,6
handsome and smiling gentleman at the reception Slightly warm coffee,7.9
Beds was comfy.  Free parking. Hairdryer didnt work.  Staff wouldnt allow me to use a glass from the bar even said I could leave a deposit..  Was not allowed to early check in even know on the website you pay a set fee it says.,6.3
Nice neighborhood No kettle in the room,8
 No room service unless you pay a daily extra,4
Nice spacey rooms with big bathroom. Good location close to Atomium and Koning Boudewijn Stadion. Free parking in the neighbourhood. Friendly personnel and quick check-in also outside reception hours. The temperature in the room was very hot in the evenings. The odeur of the cleaning liquid was too strong for me. It was like somebody has smoked in the room.,7.9
Excellent price - quality. After staying there more then 20 times the rooms are always superbly clean which for me is Number one priority for a hotel in this class. The location is in a quite residential neighborhood. The hotel is showing its age.,9.6
A perfect hotel for the reason we visited Brussels. It is near the Expo Area. ,7.5
It was ordinary. I could not get the entrance password on time by email. So i had to wait for 1 hour.,6
Nice room Quite far from the city center.The breakfast was simple.,9.6
Express checkup for late arrival.I just stay there a night because I had a flight in the very morning the room was very ok. the flow of water in the shower was very low in my room.,8.8
The beds were comfortable. There was a parking spot in front of the hotel The room was unbearably hot (sun shining in closed windows) when we arrived. Given the southerly orientation you should allow tilted window untill guests arrive.  The bathroom sink had not been cleaned there were clearly visible toothpaste traces. Please do not advertise facilities such as breakfast if they are not available. The help yourself access to the keys (in an envelope at the unmanned desk) was not very welcoming.,4
Good No air conditioner No security camera No transportation ,7.5
Close to my destination place Very loud in the room hard to sleep,5.8
Location good value for price Thin walls too much noise from other rooms,7
Stay was well prepared Easy access A bid noisy from the airplanes passing,7
Overall was an okay hotel and is located near the atomium. ,5
The reception refurbishment work is good but I think the hotel has lost its cosy appeal. The reception staff were cold and it felt like we were not welcome the room service was very expensive cold and poor quality. The rooms are looking tired and the wall paper is beginning to peel in places.,5.4
We love the location of this hotel about one 1 1/4 hours from the channel tunnel and just off the E40 for heading South into central Europe. The rooms are hyge the bathrooms are huge and have great facilities. Nothing.,9
Amazing hotel.  We had a 1 night stay on route to our next location.  It is conveniently located parking was free and easy.  The reception area was beautifully decorated as was the room and the restaurant.  We ate in the restaurant the food was delicious and good value.  The room was large with a balcony and had everything we needed for our stay.  We would definitely stay here again. ,10
Location of room on ground floor near where my motorcycle was parked giving easy access for loading. Price of whiskey in bar,7.1
Anything nice was clouded by very poor handling of charges. We got a room for a really good price for what was stated clearly as 2 adults and 1 child (both in the Booking website and in the email confirmation).When we arrived at around 8 pm reception staff told me we had to pay an extra $25 for my sons bed.When I complained and showed the email confirmation I was pointed to wording all the way down in the email  saying that charges may apply.  When I complained again and told reception wording should be made a lot clear they shrugged it off and didnt even blink to charge me.Very deceiving and really poor custome experience from the staff at reception.Not going back.,4
Location was easy to find beautifully situated and the grounds room facilities was really great to experience the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was extra but well worth the money spent. The extra touches like tea coffee water beer and cool drinks for free was exceptional. It displayed in our welcome book that we were able to purchase drinks from a vending machine but when we went to go find it it was no longer available at the hotel to guests we had to go to the bar to purchase anything further which for us at the time was not what we wanted to do we would have really enjoyed a night in the room by ourselves.,9.6
I am a frequent visitor of this Hotel and I have never been disappointed. Ideal location very clean and supported by helpful and very efficient staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel. All aspects of this Hotel are of a good standard and I therefore have no complaints.,8
Friendly staff greeted us on arrival. Spacious and spotlessly clean room. Good restaurant for dinner and a comprehensive buffet breakfast. Everything was fine,9.6
Hotel bars and restaurants Problems with roomno light over sinkshower no control on temperature tv remote not workingI admit all fixed next dayprice of breakfast,7.5
Staff during the check out was different she was extremely happy and she was keep saying apologiesses which made me feel she cares about her job and her hotel.. Staff (Katrin or anything similar to it) during the check in she was not nice at all.. There was a gentleman withour namebadge he was nice and kind.. At least tried to help.I did stay in room 327 it was nice experience but this time I did request quite room they give a room next to the motorway.. Could not sleep and extremely unhappy. ,6.3
Reception very friendly breakfast 1st class Grumpy waiter,7.1
Good location and nice rooms The smell of sewers in the corridor outside our room. The slow and badly trained staff in the restaurant.,5.8
Great hotel! Nice interior design polite staff amazing breakfast!  ,10
Very nice hotel with an amazing buffet for breakfast. ,9.6
Small but functional room sleep fun design closeness to the airport Toilet without a door could have been a challenge if I was staying for more than one day,7.9
Perfect clean room  the breakfast was very good the hotel was fully booked and still you had enough to choose. There was even fresh orange juice ,9.6
Friendly staff you feel most welcome. ,8.8
We always stay here and use the Park Sleep and Fly deal its great!  We love the food in the restaurant the room was comfortable and clean and the staff were helpful both prior to arrival and during our stay. ,10
The location to the airport its out dated out and need renovation,5
 Bed was hard as a rock pillows were extremely lofty so hard to use without hurting neck. TV didnt work,6.7
We had a junior suite which was really nice and spacious. The beds were very comfortable. The extra bed for our daughter of 16 was really very uncomfortable. The mattress was so thin she could feel the wooden frame underneath all night.,7.5
The room was upgraded a very nice room where I was able to work and relax. Paring was great I has a spot in front of the entrance. The wifi was slow could be the location of the room,9
Helpful front desk clerk Glaring lights with no way to adjust Lack of service in cafe/lounge Not disclosing I was getting a room in secondary property and not described on the web site,5.8
Parking and shuttle service was great. Proximity to the airport and services cannot be beat. Love the Van der Valk chain. The free drinks in the minibar are always nice as well. Lengthy line at checkin with one employee working.,9.2
Location. There was a cleaning lady in the room when I checked in. I returned to the reception and complained. The receptionist told me to wait about 15 min. in the lobby. No one noticed me for completion of cleaning. No apology during all process. ,5.4
Very quiet despite very closed from the airport Nice decoration Twin bed and split sheets . Very uncomfortable. Not the quality of the stuff but the concept!,7.1
Very soundproof hotel near the airport and the ring road yet you could not hear anything from outside nor from the visitors in the adjacent rooms. Complementary coffee and tea as well as mini-bar with soft drinks is always appreciated. Windows on the inside had not been cleaned properly - imprints of hands and other body parts were clearly noticeable :) Bathroom was not 100% functional shower door did not close completely and inside of the door to the bathroom had stains on it lets say it was body lotion :),7.5
Superbox single rooms! Theyre equipped with PS4s and a VR headset in every room with cool preinstalled games. There are also BT speakers in every room. On every Superbox rooms floor there is a free-of-charge minibar! The breakfast is excellent variety of things to choose from. Free airport shuttle with the nicest driver. The location is awesome if youre just there for a layover but to go to the center you need about 10min to go to the nearest (Diegem) train station. But I wouldnt say that this is a major point.,9.6
I liked the rooms very clean Hello this hotel charged me 3 nights instead of 2 nights for rooms I booked 2 rooms for Friday check in and Sunday check out but they took 1 more extra night charge for 2 rooms in which I did not use iam so upset about it and I need my money back,9
No car park charges and very good breakfast and dinner Unfortunately due to COVID gym could not be open,8
Nice and clean rooms good beds. Internet ok. Can get ( extremely ) crowdy at breakfast.,8
Fairly easy access to the RO The Tesla charging stations..impossible to get In and out of the one-way entrance/exit of parking lot because of Tesla taxis and vehicles constantly pulling in and construction site parking on road.,8
 Superbox: terrible formula for the price paid.,5.8
The room was located in a quiet area. Reception was very helpful and courteous. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Enjoyed our stay despite there being restrictions due to COVID-19. The cleaning of the air vents could be better as they contained dust.,8
standard prefere the buffet of Rotterdam  eggs cook on request better choice in cheese and charcuteri - no basic products. ok but personal make too much noices putting glasses and cup on place on the buffet. no check up at the entrance and a lot of personal is turning around and dont take empty dishes.,5.4
Good location very close to the airport and airport shuttle service was available. Although it may be helpful to extend the last shuttle to midnight. Breakfast was also good and rooms were decent DIY hotel. You need to go down to the reception to get anything you needed Restaurants downstairs were not very flexible and the arrangement was quite confusing. Figured out there were different restaurants with different menus right next to each other  Bathrooms starting to age a bit,6.3
 You claimed to have a free shuttle. You do not!,9
 They have drain Problems and the bathroom stinks. The place Looks old because the carpets are dirty.,4.6
Great breakfast convenient location next to the airport overall good value for money. pillows and bed linnen quality could be inproved,7.9
Coffee maker in room was so dirty it was not useable. When I brought this up at checkout and asked if I could grab a coffee in the lobby/breakfast bar it was laughed off. Interesting since coffee in room was listed as a feature for the room. Little more attentive and accommodating staff,5.4
Cleanliness of hotel and friendliness and helpfulness of staff at front desk No hot water Driver for shuttle bus didnt turn up. First shuttle is at 6am - would be great if a breakfast of some kind could open at say 5:30am for those wanting to catch the 6am shuttle,8
location is good beds are ok. the room had a horrible smell of smoking via the heating making it impossible to sleep. So bad.  I mentioned it to the person who brought room service (cold tomato soup which should have been hot.) and she said she would inform reception.  never happened..  as I had to leave at 5am I just sat there and left it.  AND the shuttle does not operate before 6am.  making me pay 23$ for a taxi for a distance of only a few km.  Not to be repeated Im afraid..   Viva Sheraton..     ps.  best to change hair dryers too when you renovate rooms.  the current ones you have are not very good. Nor did wifi or tv function properly.    its a shame as the hotel was recommended by a colleague but I wont return.,5
 The staying from 16.00 till 9.30 is not really 24 hours right ? As it has to be. The automats with sweets and water do take money BUT DONT give the bought products back.  In the room was no fulfilled mini bar like . why?  There were no sleepers and robes no glasses in the room  For this price - (its really high price) we were not satisfied,4.6
the location We found some cloths from previous travelers on the mattress and under the blanket and when complained that probably the sheets are not changed they didnt care and just said we write it down to tell the house keepers to be more careful!!!!The coffee line was too long I waited for 45 minutes to get my breakfast coffee. I know it was because of corona but it could be easily served by personnel table to table and not as a station with waiting line!!! ,4
The rooms are nice and very spacious the bathroom and the beds are good there is ample space to organise clothes.  The hotel is located right in front of the beach and a tram stop the Reception sells tram cards as tickets cannot be purchased onboard. Besides the beach there is absolutely nothing around the hotel not one shop not one restaurant.   If you do not drive you must take the tramway to the City Centre to find them.  The hotel restaurants themselves are cafeterias big rooms with no atmosphere.  The wifi is inconsistent and one of our rooms had zero connectivity either wifi or 3-4G.  Also it would be nice to have an electric kettle in the rooms to boil water for tea or coffee.,7.1
Value for money reasonable. Welcome help and assistance at reception.,6
The room was clean as expected. We had a small balcony at the side of the building but still with a view on the sea.  There were no carpets in the room (I dont like carpets in the room as they often contain a lot of dust). The room did have a refrigerator. It was one of those using the peltier effect for cooling. These usually dont provide a lot of noise so that would have been great in this room. However the refrigerator wasnt working. We were only staying for one night so I didnt want to make a lot of fuss about it to have it fixed.  The staff at the brasserie lack a bit of motivation to make your visit with them worth your while.,6
Great place for families free baby bed good location close to the beach. ,8
The room bright large and airy even at the end of the complex partial seaviews ! Breakfast wonderful despite being very busy staff cleared tables and immediately got us seated. No  do not disturb  signs which meant several unwanted early knocks from the cleaning service.,9
Good location and amenities at the hotel ,10
The location of the place was amazing and with a good view The staff werent cleaning the room efficiently. For example when it comes to cleaning the bed they just put the blanket and dont care whether theres anything under the blanket such as shirts charge and others. And even though its safe but there is no cameras in the elevators and stairs where there should be.,7.1
WiFi was excellent.  Location good.  Staff mediocre.  Lobby staff was much better than spa staff. It was odd that you had to take your hotel towel to the spa.  Nobody smiles.  Nobody is friendly.  I think its more of a cultural thing but a smile and hello and a response of youre welcome goes a long way and nobody says any of that.,7.1
The location cleanliness Even though there were free rooms the reception informed us to pay for half day to check us in just 2 hours before their check-in time.,7.1
A clean and large room. Good spa services. I do not recommend the hotels restaurant.,6
Room is clean. Friendly staff. Tasty in-room food.  I booked a room in the Viktoria & SPA hotel only for one night with a big hope to use their spa facilities. However my hope wasnt fulfilled as their swimming pool area jacuzzi and sauna/steam room all were full up with about 20-30 people. During these COVID-19 times I expected to see some restrictions in place on amount of people can attend spa zone. ,8
Was really good Early entry was for half price.,10
The location Asked them to print the invoice in English (vs Russian) the reception lady told me I should have warned them about it during the check in. Oh thank you next time (which will never happen) I will know there is a life hack. ,6.3
Breakfast First time I stayed in a hotel who Did not offer water and tea in room as complimentary.Spa services is waist of money. Non professionalsSwimming pool closed for maintenance ,5.8
Room and view are great we had free water tea and coffee There is also a minibar available (without fridge). Nothing verbose to said - everything is great This is a lot of text here but in general its minorities. There was a free tea/coffee in the room but only two glasses for it (not sure how they applicable for tea) without even spoons you need to request them additionally which is not so great. Also the air conditioning system seems not so strong had to open a window which produces noise.,8
Everything is exellent- design SPA clean apartments and rich tasty breakfast.  Very poor restaurant Viktoria - bad quality of food and service I would recommend to visit any other restaurant nearby so that not to spoil you stay in the hotel. ,10
The best pool in the city ( special cleaning system 2 floors below the ground) even the city residents come here for swimming at additional price. ,9
 The staff is super unprofessional never even smiles! The SPA was closed during the time of my arrival. The kitchen staff is very slow and rude. The food is awful!,5.4
Friendly staff nice room great spa! The Gym should be uptodate,7.9
Space room very comfortableNice all water activities like sweming pool spa etc .Very large comfortable lobby  Stuff Serve you without any smiling and warm attitude.They cause you to feel strange and suspected.Breakfast is excellent but the price is not match itNo reason to pay 15$ for it,7.1
Spacious and cozy. One bath robe for two not full replenishment next day no water cofe tea sugar.,9.2
 Poor attitude from reception staff. Refuse to read e mails on a Sunday.,3
 Very slow and not a customer friendly reception at checking as wel checking out,6.7
Modern clean hotel with friendly stuff Could not regulate temperature in the room high pillows very dry air music as the restaurant at the breakfast was too old,7
Poor selection and not healthy View and Spa,8
Excellent. made my stay wonderful. very close to center buses are near to the hotel take you within 5 minutes to center Victoria parks in front of the hotel are amazing. near to shopping centers and supermarkets. ,10
Breakfast was weak for a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern.. but all other is nice ,8
Proximity to Minsk Arena and Zamok Mall. Poor service in restaurant and particularly the breakfast buffet - no cups no glasses chaotic seating food items running out and layout a mess from one end to the other trying to find cutlery. Too many external young people in spa drinking beer and dive bombing the pool. Impossible for disabled guests to use stairs in the pool. People smoking in hotel bedrooms meant tobacco smell in corridors. Gift shop closed on weekends.,7.1
Location is ok Room is spacey Good shower Too expensive breakfasts and not so fantastic Terrible synthetic pillowsNo teapot and I event dot talk about complimentary water which is usual for 4* hotels ,5
Comfortable bed and room decent breakfast with a substantial buffet efficient staff. Wellness facilities (although I did not use them for lack of time). Good wifi. The restaurant decoration is rather boring canteen style. The location is not ideal for visiting fine for business trip but maybe not for tourism.,9
The reception was good and fast The room was wonderful & bug but the bed and A/C not & room service I thought was a bit weak I love the restaurant The pasta was very delicious I will like to Thanks Darva Zubko for help me to get fir taxi to the airport and keeping my bags to my flight & help me to send gifts to some my friends they could not say good bye. The air conditioning was poor the bed was annoying and I did not rest for overnight here I think bed mattress needed to be changed. The window is good but I think it needs an insect insulator to keep the Window open.,7.5
Good location spa included  Ill repair. Several lights in room didnt work. Staff once care about money and making the guests feel like we are there for the staff. Just horrible service. They do a really horrible job and then wish to change maximum they can. Its really just crazy. They are at best a 1 star hotel. All other 4 and 5 star hotels have better service and less costly. Stay away from these evil,3.8
Nice and cozy room and reasonable price. SPA was busy and didnt got a chance to enjoy it.,9.2
Almost everything Noisy fridge. Would be better to have free certificates for spa at any day (not only for the dates of stay).,8
Easy to find available parking places. Weekend breakfast starts at 7 many choices. Nice clean and comfortable room. Pet friendly with additional cost. Conditioning system was too loud.,9
 Led lights above bed are not possible to switch of at all,7
Location was excellent breakfast was excellent. The facilities were very good spa and pool to the adjoining casino. The bar was open late and the restaurant served up a great late dinner with music as well. Limited english but the people were very nice and tried to accommodate when they could. Also TVs were dated and the drapes did not pull back enough had to do by hand in one direction. Door swing from toilet and from front door were odd..,9
Location near the park Simple and enough for solo travelers only  Cleanliness of the room can be improved Access to the swimming pool could be free ,7.1
Good location breakfast and staff. ATM casino available No free water tea and coffee. Slippers and toothbrush only upon request.,7.1
I like a breakfast. Very nice pancakes with cottage cheese. ,8.8
Good location very spacious comfortable beds The disposable bed linen. The water pressure in the shower,7.1
The apartment is very nice clean and spacey the location is excellent - in the heart of the town. The owner was also very flexible with our dog.  The stairs to the upstairs bedroom are quite steep rather use it with shoes than with socks. ,10
everything was super well organized and the apartment is just perfect with children ,10
Great location short walk to the beach. Perfect accommodation for family of 5. Lovely tea shop below. ,8.3
Nice appartment seperate shower for the downstairs bedroom. Not perfectly clean. The water in the bath was not very warm. Old electric stove in the kitchen.,7
Great Location. Boiler went on all night making quite a bit of noise which made sleeping problematic. Towels (for shower..) were not provided and this was not mentioned anywhere. We were told to bring bed sheets..but nothing re towels. It would have been nice to know about this.,5
The ampartment design was nice The water pressure in the showers was terrible the sheets were made of uncomfortable fabric. We used an additional bad (we were 5) which was totally inconvinient and my daugther could not sleep at all.,4.6
Location Rooms smell of wet carpets or something ,7.1
Great bed and pillow! I had 2 amazing night sleeping on their bed!Location is excellent!  From a 5 star hotel I expected to have more facilities like an Iron board in rooms. The were no Iron board in my room and I tried to contact the reception and houskeeping  but nobody aswered the phone. Also they charge $10 for the entree to the rooftop..even if youre a guest. That is ridiculous. I was very disappointed‚òπÔ∏è regarding the rooftop. At C/O the receptionist didnt even ask how my stay was so I remain quiet.,7
Facility was very nice and well-located. The staff was very helpful and patient.  It was an enjoyable stay. All good.,9
Location was excellent  very convenient to attractions. Bed was clean and comfy.  Staff were very good. Breakfast was very average and food in the restaurant was unimaginative.,8.3
It was clean & good location I didnt like the staff behavior they was extremely rude  ,7.5
Was very convenient being able to park there. The room was nice and clean Tried to go up to the rooftop bar but the wait was so long. Would be better if the staff let hotel guests have priority over random people coming in,8
Great location friendly helpful staff breakfast fantastic  Couldnt get aircon to work,8.8
Good location Slow internet and a charge of 8$ extra for room service seems excessive,7.5
Really good breakfast. Allowed us to have a late departure even though hotel fully booked that evening. ,8.3
So close to the city centre and such a good hotel! Nothing,8.8
Location comfortable beds Staff is not friendly and rude,7.9
Location was great right in the Grand Place. The staff was very friendly and professional. Room very clean. The parking was easy to access. The shower in the room was terrible it looked like it was from the 1950s and worked the same. There was also a constant noise behind one of the walls in our room almost like a generator (no it was not the AC) really annoying.,7
extremely friendly and polite staff. Handled the problem which I faced with my room very efficiently and professionally I faced problem with room heating. As a result I had to change room,8
Room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was a good size and had a tub and shower rather than just a shower stall. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Good selection of local and international channels on the TV. Location very convenient to Brussels Central Station (this NOT the main station) and to a metro stop. The main train station Brussels South/Bruxelles Midi is a 10-15 minute taxi ride through terrible trafic. ,8
Great location comfortable bed decent room size  Door man (dark hair Mediterranean appearance) was quite greedy arrived with two light all rollers luggage he waited for 10 mins asking to take to room for us same man when we leave with three heavy ones he couldnt bothered to look or open the door all he cares is tips not service. Wifi constantly drop out needs re signed in,7.1
 The in room amenities are definitly not up to a 5 stars hotel,7.1
 Breakfast not at level of product quality to be expected from this price level and international standards,7.1
Great location. Very close to Grand Place and the Brussels train station.  Many restaurants and bars in very close proximity of the hotel. ,7.9
the summer terrace was worth a visit in a summer with great views and live music. And bed was really comfortable Breakfast time was crowded but it was expected,9.2
The friendly staff excellent location comfortable room. Breakfast was way too expensive did not avail of that on any day,7.9
Location was perfect it was clean and efficient and just what was needed.  A typical nice city hotel did everything it needed to. Secret rooftop bar was very expensive and not worth it at all - the drinks were rubbish.  The view was nice though The woman in the next room was very happy with the place so happy she made very loud happy sounds on several occasions.  The walls were not very soundproof.,7.9
